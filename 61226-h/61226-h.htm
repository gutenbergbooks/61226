“He’s taking holidays
enough. I guess he
can give us one,”
said Moses Ayer,
signing his name
laboriously uphill.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One licking more
likely,” said Lewis Hoyt.
He grinned as he took
the big smooth-faced
chip from Moses and
added his signature.
“Here, Molly, it’s your turn. Remember,
you want to leave room for all the
others that can possibly squeeze on.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I couldn’t write smaller than that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>I wouldn’t sign,” retorted Molly Royce
over his shoulder. “He’s got to stand treat
and that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>While the three signers were busy at
the master’s table, a little cloud of turkey
feathers broke suddenly over a group of
boys and girls who were gathered round the
fireplace of the big schoolhouse. Jimmy
Claiborne had thrown a handful of the
feathers he was plucking at Louis Gist.</p>

<p class='c011'>Louis, who was busy with another turkey,
dropped it and sprang at Jimmy.
Jimmy dodged among the others. The
benches were overturned. In a moment a
skirmish had broken out and the school was
a mass of dodging figures, laughs and screams.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stop that racket,” cried Moses Ayer,
pounding on the master’s table. “Listen
here!—Jimmy Claiborne, you and Louis
stop your fussing and come and sign this
petition. Quit fooling. He may be banging
at the door any minute.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>“Louis says Marion Royce don’t want
me to go on the ark,” shouted Jimmy,
“and I want to know if it’s true.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come and sign,” yelled Moses. “The
ark won’t be starting for a month and this
petition goes into effect to-day. Quit your
squabbling and come here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I tell you you <i>won’t</i> go to New Orleans
on the ark,” screamed Louis Gist, swinging
his turkey round his head as he charged
with it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind New Orleans, I tell you,”
cried Moses, reaching after Jimmy as Jimmy
dodged the turkey swung at him. “Look
out what you’re doing!” He caught at
the turkey to ward it off, tripped over a
puncheon, and went over, dragging the
turkey and its holder with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lewis Hoyt was still grinning. He
caught the passing Jimmy by a fringe of his
buckskin and drew him to the master’s desk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sign here, if you’ve got sense enough,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>he said. “You look as if you’d been rolling
in a torn feather bed. If I were Marion
Royce I’d leave you two muddle-heads
behind even if I had to fill your places with
girls.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess Marion would be mighty glad
to fill one of their places with a girl,” gasped
Moses Ayer, emerging from the little boys
who had promptly fallen over him when he
tripped.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everyone laughed and looked at Milly
Ayer. She blushed and bent over her book.
She was one of the older girls who had sat
quietly in the back rows, paying no attention
to the younger ones about the fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t mind him, Milly, he’s only your
brother,” said Louis Gist. Now that Jimmy
Claiborne was captured he could return to
finish plucking his turkey at the fireside.
“Won’t we have a grand barbecue, if the
old rascal doesn’t come!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’ll have it even if he does come,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>insisted Moses Ayer. “I guess an old toper
that can stay away from his school four days
at a time hasn’t much right to keep us from
having a holiday. I guess he’s pretty lucky
to be allowed to teach here at all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Lewis Hoyt, who was patiently guiding
Jimmy Claiborne’s hand through the evolution
of his long name, looked up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can depend on it, Master Hempstead
wouldn’t be here in Fish Creek teaching
us if he wasn’t addicted to the bowl.
He’s a scholar, and some day you’ll regret
you didn’t appreciate what he’s tried to
teach you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lewis is preaching again,” cried Moses.
“What’s Master Hempstead taught us except
the way to the Marietta tavern?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who needs to go to Marietta since the
Claibornes bought their new still,—except
to hide himself?” asked Louis Gist.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a sudden silence over all the
room. It was so quiet that Jimmy Claiborne’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>labored writing was heard, and all the
older scholars exchanged glances. The Claiborne
still had been a bitter subject at Fish
Creek, and some of the older boys had said
that it was already ruining Jimmy Claiborne.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lewis Hoyt held his hand closed over
Jimmy’s as the silence fell,—a silence timed
by the steady booming of the puncheon
mauls at the little shipyard where the ark
was building.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy’s hand trembled and stopped.
Lewis steadily drove it to the finishing of
the name.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish there wasn’t a still on the whole
length of the Ohio river,” Lewis said very
quietly. “Come here, Louis Gist, it’s your
turn to sign.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy Claiborne went back to the fire,
sullen, red-faced and silent, and while the
incident was soon dismissed by the others
he sat looking into the fire or plucking
savagely at the feathers of his turkey. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>and Louis had caught them that morning, just
outside the schoolhouse, in their turkey trap.</p>

<p class='c011'>Over at the shipyard the treenail hammers
sounded, blending their sharp raps
with the measured hollow strokes of the
mauls. All the men on the creek were
working on the ark which young Captain
Marion Royce was building to go down to
New Orleans with the spring “fresh.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jonas Sparks, the veteran shipwright,
had come down from Marietta to oversee
the work. Even Gaffir Hoyt was working
there, and Uncle Amasa Claiborne, half of
whose scalp the Indians had taken thirty
years before.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Louis Gist had told Jimmy that
Marion would not let him go. Jimmy
knew why. They were gradually coming
to distrust him. He and Kenton and
MacAfee were one party in the Fish Creek
school; Moses and Lewis and Louis Gist
another.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>He wanted to go to New Orleans. He
was entitled to. All winter long he had
planned it. Marion Royce would not dare
refuse. But Louis’ unconsidered speech
rankled in his bitter heart. He would have
been glad to escape into the woods, but he
sat sullenly plucking his turkey for the
barbecue, entrenched behind his knowledge
that he had as much right in the schoolhouse
as any of the others who chattered
around him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Free public schools had not yet been
established in Ohio, but the pioneer families
maintained a “subscription school” for
their children in primitive schoolhouses of
logs afterwards widely known as “Brush
College.” Here masters of greater or less
merit taught school six days in a week, with
no holidays. Not a few, indeed, of the
early schoolmasters of this new region were
men whom certain weaknesses of character
or appetite had exiled from the older walks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>of civilization. Except for such infirmities
many of them were instructors of remarkable
ability.</p>

<p class='c011'>Master Hempstead’s foible was the all too
common one of a fond and apparently ungovernable
liking for beverages which inebriate.
On a number of occasions he had
dismissed school in the middle of the forenoon,
and after touching homilies to his
pupils, had walked out and not been
seen again for several days. He had
then reappeared, visibly the “worse for
wear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Marietta, then a vigorous young colony
of farmers and shipwrights from New England,
was the Mecca to which Master
Hempstead’s erratic pilgrimages were directed;
and it was from one of these, after
an absence of four days, that he was returning,
in no very pleasant humor, on the
morning of our story.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the meantime his little kingdom had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>run riot and tasted the sweets of self-government.
An exuberant hilarity indeed was
in the air during these first years of the
century just past. Moreover, Ohio had
become a state that month, and daring
schemes for capturing New Orleans from
the Spanish were on foot.</p>

<p class='c011'>On every day of Master Hempstead’s
absence his pupils, numbering nineteen, of
various ages, had assembled, in expectation
of his reappearance. They played “gool,”
“I spy” and “hide-and-seek” in the
underbrush about the stumpy clearing. Of
more interest still was a trap for wild turkeys
which the boys had constructed at a
distance in the woods.</p>

<p class='c011'>This trap was a covered pen of stakes
and brush, into which a “tunnel” led from
the outside. This subway, as well as the
pen, was baited with corn, and wild turkeys,
which abounded in the forest, were thus
allured to enter. The two turkeys which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the boys were plucking this morning had
been caught in this way.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the custom at these early subscription
schools of Ohio for the master
to “stand a treat” on New Year’s Day, and
provide, at his own expense, a bushel of
hickory nuts and ten pounds of candy.
This coveted festival Master Hempstead
had ignored, much to the dissatisfaction of
his pupils; and now they determined to
bring him to terms.</p>

<p class='c011'>To guard against a surprise they had
closed the door and barricaded it with their
benches, which consisted merely of rough
“puncheons,” each having four wooden
pins for legs; and Moses Ayer, Lewis Hoyt
and Molly Royce had prepared a species of
“round robin,” containing the demands of
the school, written laboriously on a large,
smooth chip.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such was the state of affairs when, at
about ten in the forenoon, the instructor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>entered the clearing where the schoolhouse
stood, and was promptly espied by more
than one pair of sharp eyes at the one small,
four-pane window.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond doubt the man was in bad
plight. His indiscretions were heavy upon
him; a raging headache and many other
aches oppressed him sorely; his coonskin
cap was pulled low over watery eyes. He
noted the smoke from the rock chimney
and strode to the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the latch-string, that ancient token
of hospitality, had disappeared within its
hole, and the door itself was fast shut. He
thundered at it with his fist, but obtained
no response, unless an ambiguous and irritating
snicker from within could be thus
construed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Open the door! It is I, the master!
Open this door!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still no response; but now the window
was pushed slowly aside, and out through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>the hole there came a long stick, to the end
of which was tied a huge, fresh, white-walnut
chip; on the smoothed side of this the
master at length noticed there was a black,
coarse scrawl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s this?” exclaimed the irate
pedagogue, starting backward as they
dangled the chip under his nose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Read it, master!” yelled a chorus of
wild voices from within the dark hole.
“Read it, master! Ye can’t come in till
ye do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With a snarl of disdain Master Hempstead
snatched at the chip.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Read it!’” he muttered. “That’s
more than you could do yourselves, I warrant.
What blockhead of ye wrote this? What
ignoramus of ye spelled it?” In truth the
spelling was not above reproach. But those
were pioneer days. The chip read as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>We the undersined Scollars of Fish
Creke want and are determined to have a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Hollerday. You didn’t give us one at
New Yere’s. You can’t kepe school here
again til you do. Ohio is a State. We
want to cellarbrate it. We dimmand that
you get a bushel of hickerry nuts, or wallnuts
ten ponds of Candy and five ponds of
Raizeans. Say you will or you cant come
in. Sine your name at the bottom of this
with your led pensel to let us know you
mene it and all will yit be wel. If you
dont you cant never come in here again for
you are a bad-drinking Old Fellar.</p>

<p class='c014'>This, as must be confessed, was hardly respectful
or complimentary, but these were
rough times and these children had much
to learn. Master Hempstead was accustomed
to the utmost consideration. The man of
learning had then, as now, the highest
place in the regard of the community,
and his anger seethed, as, with the hastily
adjusted aid of his horn-bowed glasses, he
perused this gage of rebellion.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“Numskulls!” he shouted. “After
all I have taught ye, to spell like that!
Y-e-r-e, year! R-a-i-z-e-a-n-s, raisins!
T-i-l, till! P-o-n-d-s, pounds! S-i-n-e,
sign! O you young ignoramuses! You
will go out into the world and disgrace
me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sign your name, master!” shrilled the
unfeeling chorus inside.</p>

<p class='c011'>“O you young vipers! Vipers whom I
have cherished in my bosom! <i>Mox anguis
recreatus!</i> Sting the hand that nourished
you! And spell like that!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sign it, master! You got to sign it!
H-i-l-l-e-l H-e-m-p-s-t-e-a-d, Hillel Hempstead.
Sign it!” still yelled the dissonant
chorus within.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ingrates! Thankless cubs! Good instruction
has been wasted on ye! Open the
door, that I may flog it out of ye!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No—no—no, master, you can’t come
in!” retorted the young rebels. “You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>have got to sign that, and promise not to
whip us!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Compacts with a mob! Truces with
rebels! Never!” shouted the wordy old
schoolmaster.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Parley is at an end. Prepare to
suffer. You shall have your deserts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Master Hempstead hurled the walnut
chip back in at the window—where it
caused lively dodging of youthful heads—and
made ready for active operations.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the wood-pile hard by lay a small
hickory log, some ten feet in length and
four or five inches in diameter. Heaving
this up in his arms, he ran with it full tilt
against the door, delivering a blow which
made the whole house tremble and started
the latch-bar in its socket.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hear that, ungrateful hearts!” he
vociferated. “I am now illustrating to ye
the principle of the battering-ram, which
played so noble a part in the wars of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>antiquity. Vespasian and Titus employed
it against the gates of stiff-necked Jerusalem.
And thus do I batter in the gate of this
stronghold of young deviltry!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He came <i>bang!</i> against the door again,
this time with such effect that the latch
gave way and the benches were pushed back.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet again the doughty pedagogue drew
back, and panting hard, made another
staggering rush with his improvised ram.
This time the shock was so forceful that
everything gave way, so suddenly that both
master and “ram” fell in headlong at the
doorway.</p>

<p class='c011'>The “principle,” indeed, was well illustrated;
but Master Hempstead had still to
deal, hand to hand, with his youthful rebels.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lewis, Moses and the others were
athletic youngsters, and the master, owing
perhaps to his many “vacations” at
Marietta, was at best somewhat tottery.</p>

<p class='c011'>The battle went sorely against him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>With shouts of triumph they dragged him
forth into the yard, and holding him down
in the snow, clamored loud for his signature.
Still, with reproaches, he refused it, calling
down upon them the vengeance of all
known powers of good and evil.</p>

<p class='c011'>But now an interruption occurred.
Milly Ayer, who had thus far sat quietly
in the back row, now donned her hood in
haste, and slipping forth in the midst of the
mêlée, ran down to the creek bank, where
the ark was being built, to summon aid.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Help! help!” she cried, then waved
her red hood to attract attention, for her
cries were drowned in the din of hammers
below.</p>

<p class='c011'>Young Captain Royce was the first to
see and hear. Between Milly and himself
there had long existed a warm friendship.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it, Milly? What’s happened?”
he shouted, and all the hammers stopped
short.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“O Marion, come quick!” cried Milly.
“They are fighting at the schoolhouse!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The young captain was half-way up the
bluff before these words were all spoken.
The others followed him; even old Jonas
Sparks, Gaffir Hoyt and Uncle Amasa Claiborne
hurried stiffly to the schoolhouse in
the wake of Marion Royce and Milly.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the most sedate of them could but
smile at the spectacle which was there
presented. Moses Ayer and Lewis Hoyt
were holding Master Hempstead fast with
his back to a tree trunk, while Louis Gist
was trying to bind him to it with green
hazel withes. The smaller boys, equally
excited, were endeavoring to bear a hand,
and yelled like young redskins; while Molly
Royce and the other girls looked on with
something akin to enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here, here, boys! Do you know
what you are doing?” the young captain
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“What’s the trouble?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’s got to sign it!” shouted Moses,
hotly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, he’s got to!” yelled Lewis.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Mack, help us make him sign
it!” chimed in Molly Royce.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Be quiet, Molly!” replied Marion,
putting his impetuous young sister aside
with one hand as he strode nearer. “We
will see about this. Let go, Lewis! Let
go, Mose! Master Hempstead, what’s the
matter here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The master, who had been kicking hard
and hitting right and left at his assailants,
recovered his dignity and struck an attitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How sharper than a serpent’s tooth is
such ingratitude!” he cried, in injured
accents. “These whom I have taught with
so great patience, whose dull wits I have
fostered, lo, they have lifted up the heel
against me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what is it, Master Hempstead,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>that they want you to sign?” asked Marion,
laughing in spite of himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An exorbitant demand! Preposterous
extortion! Stuck under my very nose at
the schoolhouse door on an illiterate chip!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And he’s got to sign it!” interrupted Mose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what is it? Let’s see it,” said
Marion.</p>

<p class='c011'>With that, Jimmy Hoyt came running
with the chip, which, on being read aloud,
caused Jonas Sparks and Uncle Amasa Claiborne,
who had now come up, to chuckle
audibly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I kinder reckon, master, that
they was in a fair way to make ye put yer
name to it!” cried the old shipwright.
“I guess ye better sign it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no, but the rising gineration
musn’t be incouraged to be sassy!” cried
Gaffir Hoyt. “They’re sassy enough now.
Give ’em an inch and they’ll take an ell.”
Uncle Amasa agreed with him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“Cut some switches and drub the young
scamps,” said Uncle Amasa.</p>

<p class='c011'>Public opinion being thus divided, every
one, including Milly Ayer, looked to Marion
for the guiding word. Already this little
community had come to rely upon his
judgment in emergencies.</p>

<p class='c011'>The young captain laughed good-humoredly.
“I don’t want to set my word
before that of my elders,” he said, “but
drubbing isn’t always the best medicine.
The boys have been rough and hasty. But
from all accounts, Master Hempstead hasn’t
set them quite so good an example of late
as we wish he would. Lewis, you and Mose
and Molly must beg Master Hempstead’s
forgiveness for misusing him. If they do that,
you will overlook it, master, will you not?”</p>

<p><span class='small'>“HEY, WHAT? FORGIVE THEM!”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Hey, what? Forgive them!” cried
the still agitated pedagogue. “Forgive
them! Well, anything but their bad spelling!
Anything but that!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“Wal, master, that is a fault you must
try to remedy!” cried old Jonas, laughing.
“Good spelling is the gift of Heaven. I
only wish that it had been given to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But the holiday!” exclaimed Molly.
“We want the holiday!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you say, Master Hempstead?”
Marion asked him, with much respect.
His manner did more than any words could
have done to remind the young people of
the great regard in which a master was and
should be held. “A holiday to celebrate
the admission of Ohio to the Union would
be no very bad thing, would it? Suppose
you give them one and let us all come
to it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I haven’t the means. I’m a poor
man!” protested the master. “Candy and
raisins cost good money at Marietta.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And so does gin and whisky!” muttered
Moses, under his breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush, Moses!” said Marion. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>turned to the other older men. “How
would it be if we all give something, and
have the celebration next month just before
the ark starts to New Orleans?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The faces of the young people fell visibly
at this suggestion of postponement, but
the motion was carried, and it was arranged
that the holiday should take place the day
before the ark should leave for its long
adventurous voyage down the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c011'>The master pointed to the gaping
schoolhouse doorway. “In, ye renegades,”
he ordered, and they trooped noisily in to
straighten the overturned benches and settle
down to their study after the four days of
unofficial vacation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy Claiborne did not follow them.
He waited until the men were starting back
to the shipyard, then he stopped Marion
Royce.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Louis Gist says you won’t let me go
on the ark,” he said, fixing the young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>captain with his sombre, discontented eyes.
“I guess Uncle Amasa could make you,
seeing what a share we’ve got in the cargo,
but I just wanted to ask you if it’s true—what
Louis said—that you don’t want me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion wished, as he looked gravely at
the boy, that the ark were not taking the
Claibornes’ share of the cargo at all, but he
only said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“That depends on yourself, Jimmy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy made no answer in words. He
turned and strode off towards the woods
behind the schoolhouse clearing. Marion
called to him, but he gave no sign of
hearing, and after waiting a moment longer
Marion went back to his work.</p>

Young Captain Royce
went slowly back to
the shipyard, thinking
of the sullen look in
Jimmy Claiborne’s
eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The boy means to
make trouble,” he said
to himself. But beyond the annoyance
which would result from being obliged to
refuse, if Jimmy got Uncle Amasa to plead
for him, there seemed to be nothing much
that Jimmy could do. Young as he was—scarcely
twenty-two—Marion Royce had
already won the confidence of the settlement
by his courage and coolness, and those who
had chosen him as leader and captain would
certainly uphold him in any position which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>he might take in regard to the selection of
his crew. But between being merely upheld
in a disagreeable duty, and having the
cordial good feeling of all the shareholders,
there was much to choose.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was tempted, as he went along
through the woods between the little shipyard
and the schoolhouse, to turn a deaf ear
to his own better judgment. But he had made
three trips down the river to New Orleans,
and he knew the importance of an efficient
crew, just as he knew the danger of a single
insubordinate spirit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If it were anybody else but Jimmy
Claiborne”, he thought, “it would not so
much matter.” There were the twenty
barrels of peach brandy and whisky—the
Claibornes’ share of the cargo—and in the
long monotonous days and nights only
ceaseless vigilance would keep the men
from broaching them. If Jimmy were in
the crew, his sense of proprietorship in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>portion of the cargo would make the danger
of it very much greater.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a voyage of untold perils. Every
year an increasing number of white outlaws,
hidden in the caves along the river, harried
and robbed the boatmen who floated down
from the upper settlements. There were
lurking bands of hostile Indians. And there
was the river itself with its treacheries; its
snags; its mud bars and its floods. It was
no unusual thing for an ark to set out as
this one was about to do, provided against
all foreseeable disasters, and never be heard
from afterward. Some were wrecked, some
were robbed and their crews obscurely
murdered. But no tidings of their fate
came back to the solitary homes on the
upper Ohio.</p>

<p class='c011'>To set out on such a voyage with a
single man or boy who could not be trusted,
might mean the loss of the boat or even of
every life on board of her. Marion Royce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>looked ahead of him, suddenly throwing
back his shoulders and breathing deeply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s got to come, and it had better be
over with at once,” he said aloud. “Oh,
Uncle Amasa! Ho, Uncle Amasa! Hold
on and let me catch up with you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man could be seen through the
thinning trees that covered the slope leading
down to the creek’s mouth. He stopped
and waited for the captain to come up to
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’ll get them twenty barrels down
from the still this afternoon, son,” he began,
as Marion joined him. “It’s time to
get your cargo collected, and them casks
will do just as well down here at the shed
where there’s room for ’em. We’re pretty
crowded with them up to the still.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It isn’t the cargo I’m worrying so
much about,” said the captain slowly.
“It’s the supercargo.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man looked at him shrewdly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>He understood as well as if Marion had
told him in so many words that he did not
want to take Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s a rough voyage,” the captain said.
“If I thought it would help to make a man
of Jimmy I’d take him and risk his stirring
up a feeling of insubordination in those
Marietta fellows that he knows better than
I do. But my feeling is that Jimmy ought
to stay at home. There’s plenty of chance
for him to show what stuff he’s made of,
and if we get back all right we may be
able to take him next year. The boy’s a
little wild, and it won’t do him any good
to go to Natchez—all devildom is loose at
Natchez. And then there may be a French
fleet at New Orleans. There may be
fighting. The Spaniards may have shut
the city in our faces. We may have to
fight to be allowed to land, but if we do
have to, I guess ten thousand or so rivermen
will help us to show the Spanish governor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>whether he can shut the gate of the world
to us Americans.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye think there’s any truth in that tale
of Bonaparte’s seizing the Mississippi, son?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” said the captain, “I don’t.
I believe Jefferson is going to buy out
the Spaniards or drive them home, and that
the country will belong to us clear to the
sea.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hm,” said the old man. “Well, son,
if there’s goin’ to be any such doings down
to New Orleans, I’d be terrible sorry for
Jimmy to miss it. I reckon I couldn’t very
well leave Maria. I expect I’m pretty
tolerable old for a trip like what you say it
is to go down the river, even when everything
is fav’rable. I’d mebby do best to
cossett what’s left of my scalp and not run
the risk of losing it to a strange Indian
when I could just as easy lose it to one
nearer home. I don’t reckon Maria would
consent to my going, but I’d set a right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>smart store on one of our family havin’ a
hand in them doin’s down to New Orleans,
and I reckon them rivermen at Natchez
won’t corrupt Jim any more than the
roustabouts around Marietta shipyard. I just
reckon you’ll have to take him along, son.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no resentment whatever in
the old man’s tone. He made no defense
of Jimmy, although Jimmy was his idolized
grandson, and Jimmy’s father had been
taken captive by the Indians before Jimmy
was a year old—which was sixteen years
ago—and nothing had ever been heard of
him. But Uncle Amasa had lived as a
pioneer among pioneers, where every man
had to stand by himself, for himself, and for
those whom his presence protected. He
made no defense of Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was an uncomfortably long pause.
They were near enough to the little shipyard
at the mouth of the creek, so that they
stopped to finish their discussion before they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>joined the men who were working. Little
old Uncle Amasa stood shrunken like a
withered bush on which a workman had
hung his coat and cap. Captain Royce
faced him, young and alert and vigorous,
sure of his judgment, but reluctant to oppose
the old man whom the entire settlement
loved.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Uncle Amasa,” he said at length,
smiling at the shrewd light-gray eyes that
looked into his, “you’ve always been too
hasty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aye,” admitted the old pioneer, “and
if I’d been a trifle hastier, I’d ’a’ saved my
whole scalp instead of only half of it. It’s
a grand thing to be hasty, son, when you’re
dealing with savages.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You were hasty when you bought the
still without considering how it would
affect the settlement here,” continued the
captain, gravely. “Until this year, good
Master Hempstead and his like had to go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>clear to Marietta to indulge their little foibles.
You want me to tell you why you
are so anxious to have Jimmy go with me
on this trip? It’s because you see you were
too hasty, and you want to separate him as
far as possible from that new still. But I’m
afraid that you can’t do that so long as I am
taking the twenty barrels of brandy and
whisky along in the cargo. I’ll take the
cargo, or I’ll take Jimmy. I can’t take
both even for all the things you’ve done for
me and mine, and for the help you’ve been
in building the ark here. As long as I’m
captain, and the whole settlement has
appointed me to represent them in disposing
of their year’s harvest and work, I owe
my first duty to the safety of the cargo
and the lives I’m taking along with me.
The Marietta hands will have no right in the
boat, and I can handle them if Jimmy isn’t
along to stir up insubordination.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’ll be along,” said Uncle Amasa,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>cheerily. “If there are to be doin’s at
New Orleans, I’d like for him to see them
and have them to tell to his children when
he grows old. Life is pretty much all in
the way you see it, and I’ve seen a heap,
and I want that Jimmy should. The only
comfort I’ve ever had in these long years
since his pa disappeared is been in thinking
of the strange secrets he must have got to
know. I reckon if James was to come back
from captivity alive, I’d be so curious to
hear about his experiences that I’d clean
forget to rejoice at having him home again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The young captain looked at Uncle
Amasa. Queer characters were the rule
rather than the exception among the settlers
who had willingly turned their backs
on civilization and safety, but in all his
experience he knew of no other pioneer
whose foolhardiness could be inspired by
sheer curiosity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you mean to say, Uncle Amasa,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>that since you can’t go yourself the chance
of your grandson seeing new things makes
you insist upon my taking him, even if his
presence jeopardizes the welfare and success
of the whole expedition?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jimmy will be good, I reckon,” said
the old man, “and he’s old enough now;
so I should like for him to see a little of
the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’re a shareholder, like the rest of
us,” said the captain, “and I don’t mean to
seem disrespectful; but I think you’re acting
hastily, Uncle Amasa, and I hope you won’t
encourage Jimmy to feel that he has a right
to come without my consent, for I should
have to put him off, and that would be a
humiliation, and I don’t want to embitter
him any more than I can help. But I
won’t have him on the ark, and that’s all I
can say about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, well, we won’t discuss it, son;
we won’t discuss it at all,” said Uncle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Amasa. “But I’d like to know how ye
think I would look going back to his
widowed mother and telling her that you
didn’t trust her only son to conduct himself
as bravely as any of you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>A smile broke over the young captain’s
face at the idea of any such message going
to the acrid lady who had made the
Claibornes’ home-clearing a place to be
cautiously approached and discreetly avoided.
“I wouldn’t say anything to Maria at all,”
he advised. “I would just gradually get
Jimmy out of the notion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The captain felt that he had not come
out of the argument at all well. It seemed
rather absurd for a man to set himself
against a boy—a boy, moreover, whom he
had seen grow up—but there were so many
reasons for Jimmy’s own sake why he
should not be allowed to go that Uncle
Amasa’s calm refusal to even consider them
filled him with uneasiness. If the grandson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>proved as unimpressionable as the
grandfather, there was trouble ahead. And
Marion Royce felt that he was undertaking
enough in this venture without adding anything
that might bring about disorder or
mutiny.</p>

<p class='c011'>They went down the hill, the captain
silent, Uncle Amasa gossiping cheerily as
a snow-bird, and both men were soon at
work on the great ninety-foot ark or
“broadhorn” that still rested on its rude
ways at the edge of the creek.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’ll get it into the water before
night,” said the captain, looking lovingly
at the unwieldy bulk that was more like a
scow, built to be towed, than like a boat
designed to navigate itself among channels
and currents. It would, indeed, be more
at the mercy of the elements than any scow,
because its high freeboard would catch the
wind as well as its clumsy upperdeck. It
was built of rough hewn timbers, and put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>together with pins and treenails, so that it
could be readily taken apart and sold as
lumber for house-building in New Orleans,
when its service as a cargo boat should be
over.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jonas Sparks, the old Marietta shipwright,
who was overseeing the work,
nodded at the captain. There was still a
vast amount of decking or roofing to be
done, and for this some of the lumber was
still to be brought over from Marietta sawmill.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would be a good job done,” said
Jonas Sparks, “if you could get your
timber sawed up to Marietta while she
is swelling. It will save that much
time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The new Pittsburgh mill hands haven’t
come,” said the captain, “and they can’t
get enough men at Marietta to work on
the new brig and run the mill. The men
won’t work. I expect we’ll have to go up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>and saw the lumber ourselves. What do
you think?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” said Jonas, to whom the difficulty
of getting any sort of skilled or regular
labor was too familiar to cause annoyance,
“we’ll just put her into the water and see
what can be done about getting the boards.
There comes Charlie Hoyt with another
load of the Claibornes’ whisky.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A wagon team was drawing into the
shipyard clearing with a load of casks.
Everyone about the ark went to the shed
in which the cargo for the ark was being
gradually piled up, and soon the men were
busy helping Charlie Hoyt unload. When
he had finally driven off again, considerable
time had been wasted, and in the afternoon,
when the boys trooped down after school
to help in the launching, they found that it
had been necessary to postpone it for
another day. Next month, when the river
should have risen with the melting snows,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>the delay of a day might mean all the difference
between success and failure, safety
and total wreck. But the Ohio was still
locked between its ice banks, below the
mouth of the creek, and a day meant little
or nothing to the pioneers of the wilderness.</p>

<p class='c011'>As thieving Indians occasionally slipped
into the clearings at night, Jonas Sparks
had volunteered to sleep in the shed, which
served as storage warehouse for such portions
of the cargo as the settlers had already
brought down. He took his meals at the
Royces, however, and it was sometimes late
before he picked up his lantern and his rifle
and went over to the shipyard.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was late that night. There was no
moon, and his lighted lantern showed the
tree trunks like moving shapes in the snow;
but the old shipwright trudged along as
fearless as in the open day, swinging his
lantern as if it did not make him a target
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>for any unseen red or white enemy who
might be skulking through the woods.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly he began to run. Flames had
shot up in the clearing around the shipyard,
and he heard the crackle of the huge pillar
of fire that flared and waved to the height
of the treetops.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The ark is burning!” he shouted,
forgetting in his excitement that no one
could possibly hear him. He rushed down
to the clearing and saw the great flames
lapping up the shed like thirsty dogs.
Bright embers floated out over the trees,
and some circled down onto the ark, which
had not yet begun to burn. As the old
shipbuilder saw all this, he realized that
the fire was too far along for anyone to stop
it or to hope to save any of the cargo in
the shed. The light in the sky would soon
bring all the settlers in the neighborhood,
accustomed as they were to an alert vigilance
against Indian surprises. So he hurried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>down to the creek to break through the
covering of snowy ice and carry bucketful
upon bucketful of water, which he poured
over the half-decked boat. The intense
heat of the fire so close at hand was scorching
the timbers and the steam rose in white
masses as the icy creek water ran in thin
streams over the ark.</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion Royce was the first to reach the
fire. The flames were at their height,
waving long streamers above the treetops so
that their light could be seen for ten miles
down the river, and settlers farther down
thought that Marietta was burning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What could have started it?” asked
the captain, as he and Jonas came up from
the creek with a hogshead nearly filled
between them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t imagine,” said the shipbuilder.
“The Indians would rather have stolen
the stuff than burnt it up, and no one round
hereabouts has any grudge agin’ the ark.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“You didn’t see anyone?” asked the
captain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No one but Jimmy Claiborne,” answered
Jonas. “Just as I came into the
clearing I saw him runnin’ for dear life
along the road to the Ayreses, to get help,
I reckon, and that’s why I didn’t lose any
time carryin’ the alarm. I knew he’d take
it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jimmy Claiborne!” echoed the captain.
A thought flashed into his mind, but
he refused to consider it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder if we couldn’t slide the
blocks out from under her and let her drop
down the ways,” he said. “She’s beginning
to burn here at the bow, from the
heat. We can’t keep her from burning.
The ways are bound to go. Look, Jonas!
Merciful goodness—Look out!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The shed had caved in. The column
of fire hung for a moment like the jet of a
waterspout, then dropped back into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>heart of the fire, and the flames billowed
out in a huge circle that swept the bows of
the ark and curled in blue threads about
the ways on which it rested.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We can’t do it singlehanded,” shouted
Jonas, above the terrible roar of the fire.
“We can’t move it. It’s got to go unless
somebody comes to help us. It’s frozen to
the ways and the tackle is all in the shed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’ve got to do it,” the captain
shouted back. He took up a puncheon
maul and began desperately pounding at the
blocks that kept the ninety-foot hull from
dropping down the snowy, ice-crusted ways.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Great stars, man, can’t you let it
alone?” cried the shipwright. “Can’t
you see that even if you did start her she’d
smash herself on the bottom of the creek?
We’ve got to have men and tackle to let
her down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a shout from the edge of the
clearing, and Jonas and the captain turned to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>see Moses Ayer and Lewis Hoyt and Louis
Gist come plunging towards them, having
outrun their elders who were following.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Run to Uncle Amasa’s to get his
hoisting tackle,” cried Jonas to Louis Gist.
“We’ve got to launch the ark, and everything
we had here is burning up in the
shed. Here, Mose, come and tote water.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The two boys hurried to carry out his
orders, and Lewis Hoyt caught up a board
and began shoveling snow onto the ark.
The heat was frightful, and the boys smelt
their buckskins singeing as they rushed
about the fire, and the cinders fell on
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where’s Jimmy Claiborne?” asked
Moses Ayer when Louis came back alone
with the rope and tackle, staggering under
the weight of the heavy coil.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wasn’t there,” gasped Louis. “Uncle
Amasa’s on the way, though.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion Royce turned sharply to Moses.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“Jimmy went to your house to give the
alarm,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He never came to our house,” declared
Moses. “I saw the fire myself, through
the chink over my bed where the plug has
come out. I called Pop and came over.
Jimmy never came near us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The captain’s face set. “We’ve no
time to bother about Jimmy, now,” he
said. “One of you carry this tackle into
that biggest walnut tree and make it fast
about fifteen feet above the ground. It’s
only to steady the strain as she drops down.
Make it fast, though. We don’t want it
giving way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Moses was already half-way to the tree.
“All right,” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lighted only by the fire that reflected
red pools in the snow, the men and boys
worked at the launching that should save
the ark. The great flatboat was frozen to
the ways, and it seemed as if nothing but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>superhuman power would ever start it.
Then, suddenly, an appalling report came
from the burning shed. The ground shook
with it, and the flames burst out again into
vast torches that flared above the trees a
moment and then fell back extinguished.
Timbers and brands of fire shot hither and
thither through the air. The men sprung
away with terrorized faces.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The whisky casks have burst,” said
the captain. “I thought they had gone
long ago. Is anyone hurt?”</p>

<p class='c011'>At the edge of the clearing the light of the
flames showed a figure outstretched—a grim
patch of darkness on the reddened snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lewis Hoyt was the first to reach it.
He turned to face the anxious men who
hurried to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s Master Hempstead!” he cried.
“He isn’t killed. This beam must have
struck him and knocked him down as he
was coming to the fire.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Half a dozen men bent down to examine
the crumpled figure of the unconscious
schoolmaster, and as they were separating
to let the captain and Charlie Hoyt carry
him away to be cared for by the women at
the Royces, a shout made them turn to the
fire again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The ark!” cried a dozen voices.
“The ark is going!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The vibration of the explosion had
accomplished what the men alone could
not have done, and the ark was slipping
down the ways.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here,” cried Marion Royce, “take
this,” and quite unconscious that it was a
human being whom he was handing over
absently, he dashed back to the assistance
of Jonas Sparks.</p>

<p class='c011'>But by the time he reached the ways
the ark was grinding the ice of the creek,
her bottom scraping the bed of the shallow
stream.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Moses Ayer came up, trembling from
the terrible strain on the windlass when the
ark shot down. The perspiration was
raining down his drawn, excited face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She’s launched!” he said.</p>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/i061.jpg' width='200' height='286' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
As the captain handed over the
schoolmaster’s inert form,
he was too full of alarm
to notice that the arms
which received it were
Jimmy Claiborne’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is he dead?” asked
Jimmy, in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p class='c011'>Charlie Hoyt stared at him. “Dod
rot!” he ejaculated. “You’re trembling!
What’s the matter with you? The master’s
not dead. Look at that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Jimmy saw the schoolmaster’s
breath coming faintly like a frosty
thread. He drew his own breath more
freely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you’re afraid to carry him, I’ll call
Mose,” went on Charlie. “He’s hurt on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>the head. If it weren’t for that we could
leave him over there by the fire till he
sobers up. I wonder where he got it.
Stocked up at Marietta, most likely. Here’s
part of a corn-bin cover, shot out of the
fire. We can lay him on that. It will
carry better.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The long bin cover, with its charred
edges, was a clumsy thing to carry, and the
two stumbled slowly along the dark path
to the Royce’s cabin. They set their burden
down several times to rest and get a
better hold. Once Charlie fell and the
schoolmaster slid from his rude stretcher
into the snow. Perspiring and breathless
they picked him up again and went heavily
on.</p>

<p class='c011'>Several women had gathered at the
Royce’s from the neighboring cabins.
They were all brave women, used to the
alarms and hardships of their wild life, and
they received the little party, that looked so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>much grimmer than it was, without excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It looks to me kinder like a fight,”
said Charlie, when he had examined the
master’s bruises carefully in the light of a
tallow dip.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must have been a fight,” said Mrs.
Royce. “That is never a blow from a
flying timber. His eye is puffing up, too.
He couldn’t have been lying long when you
found him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The master roused a little. His arm
went out as if to ward a blow. “They’ll
drive—me—out,” he muttered. “How—tish
y’se’f—cherished ’n my bosom—’n ye
turn—’gainsht me.” His arm fell and he
began to weep; a pitiable object.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy had taken no part in his resuscitation.
He stood looking into the fire,
beside the hearth. Now that he no longer
feared that the schoolmaster would die, he
was absorbed in his own sullen thoughts.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Milly Ayer saw his look, and his clenched
hands, and went over to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You didn’t come back to school,” she
said. “We missed you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll never go back to that school,” he
answered. She could see the flush creep
over his dark face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Jimmy!” she said. “When
there’s hardly a month more before everybody
will be going off on the ark?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s why.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Milly reddened. She had forgotten in
the excitement of the fire the trouble of
the morning that had brought the quarrel
between Jimmy and Louis Gist. She was
about to tell him that Marion would change
his mind, when the door flew open and
her brother Mose and Shadwell Lincoln
burst in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The ark is all safe,” they both cried
at once. “The men are going to stay
about and watch, though. Everything’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>gone. All the flax, and the Hoyt’s corn,
and the Claiborne whisky. And pretty
near all the carpentering tools of the neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a grave loss. Tools were expensive
and hard to get, and the rotted flax
that had been stored in the shed had been
intended to clothe the settlement for a year.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Has anyone found out who started it?”
asked Mrs. Royce, to turn the thoughts of
the others from their common loss.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moses threw a meaning look toward
Jimmy Claiborne. “We haven’t <i>found out</i>,”
he said, with hot-headed emphasis, “but
everybody has a suspicion. It was done by
someone who had a grudge agin the ark
and wanted to set it afire to spite Marion
Royce. The ark’s built of such heavy
timber that it wouldn’t burn easily, but if
the shed burned the ark was bound to go
with it. And it would have gone, too, if
Jonas and Marion hadn’t saved it.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“No one in the settlement would have
taken such a revenge as that,” said Mrs.
Royce.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just you wait and see,” said Mose. He
was boiling with indignation. Not that he
had anything against Jimmy Claiborne,
himself. He was simply a born partisan.
Whatever came up, he must take sides and,
usually, come to blows to settle it. Until
a blow had been struck, Mose seldom
considered a matter disposed of. He bore
upon his person the evidence that he lived
up to his point of view. “I guess whoever
did it will be found out pretty soon, and
’pears to me Fish Creek won’t be the place
for him after that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The women who had joined in the
growing disapproval of the Claibornes in
regard to bringing a still into Fish Creek
settlement found themselves embarrassed at
having the prejudice taking such direct
expression. They wished they had not all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>spoken so openly before those who were too
young to reason or be discreet. It was
Milly who saved the situation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I ought to go home,” she said.
“Mother and the children are alone. Mose,
are you coming?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t,” said Mose. “I’ve got to
help Marion. He wants me to be on hand.
Mebby to-morrow he’ll want us to start up
to Marietta to help cut the lumber, if the
new hands don’t get there from Pittsburgh.
The new brig’s keeping everyone busy over
to Marietta.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jimmy,” said Milly, “will you take
me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy reached for a rifle that stood
among several muskets in a rude rack near
the fireplace. The Ayers’ clearing was one
of the farthest away, and while the neighborhood
had been safe from prowling
Indians for over a year the men still went
about armed at night. He looked carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>to the flint and priming, and taking it in
his arm, waited for her while she said good night.</p>

<p class='c011'>For awhile they trudged in silence.
Mose’s ill-considered words were ringing in
their ears. As they skirted the shipyard
clearing they saw the men silhouetted against
the burning heap of ruins. Jimmy gripped
his rifle in a spasm of unreasoning hate.
He wondered how little old Uncle Amasa
could be among them; friendly, wise, harboring
no resentment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Isn’t that Uncle Amasa, there by the
maple tree?” asked Milly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that’s him,” said Jimmy.
“’Twouldn’t be <i>me</i>, that’s certain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s all a mistake,” said Milly. “You
mustn’t think of what schoolboys say.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess they heard their elders say it.
It wouldn’t have come popping into their
heads alone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You mustn’t mind,” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“You don’t catch me minding,” said
Jimmy, throwing his head back. “I’m not
through with Fish Creek settlement yet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a long silence, broken only
by their feet in the crusted snow. Milly
thought pityingly of the thankless home
that Maria Claiborne had made for Jimmy
and his grandfather. She wished that
Marion had not said so positively that he
would not have Jimmy on the ark. She
would talk to Marion to-morrow and try to
win him over. Now that the Claiborne
cargo was destroyed, he would be apt to reconsider.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You may get a chance to go to New
Orleans, after all,” she said. “You mustn’t
blame Marion, Jimmy. Think of the responsibility
he will have, every day and night
of that long journey—and, perhaps, fighting.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I guess I can hold up my end of
the fighting,” said Jimmy. “I never failed
to do it yet.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“That’s the trouble,” said Milly. “You
and Kenton and MacAfee are so quarrelsome.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know what you mean, Milly,” said
Jimmy, feeling his heart harden against
even her friendliness. “You’re going to
try to persuade Marion to take me. Well,
I ain’t going to have you do it. I won’t go.
Not that way. Marion’s got to take me
because I’m as good a man as the rest of ’em,
or I don’t go. And if he should happen to
change his mind and want me, he’ll have to
ask me mighty perticular. I won’t be hanging
round having every one point to me as
the boy that set fire to the building shed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are you going to do?” she asked,
anxiously. “Oh, Jimmy, <i>promise</i> me that
it won’t be something you’ll be sorry for.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sorry? I guess not. I haven’t decided
what I’ll do yet,” he added. “I’m going
down to my place and think about it, and
mebby get some beaver skins. The last time
I was down I saw signs of them on a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>creek. They’re mighty scarce now. Uncle
Amasa says they won’t be a beaver between
here and Cincinnati next year.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Milly felt relieved. The place Jimmy
spoke of was an almost unbroken strip of
forest, about five miles away, on which
Jimmy had made “tomahawk improvements”—girdled
a few trees and planted a
little patch of corn. He and Uncle Amasa
had built a cabin there, and sometimes
stayed there for weeks on end when Maria
was more than usually fiery-tempered.
Trappers knew the little cabin well.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You won’t go till Marion gets through
with the lumber sawing?” she asked.
“There’ll be so few men at the settlement
if they have to help saw lumber up at
Marietta.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy could not see her face, but her
matter-of-course tone staggered him. He
wondered if girls could really feel things—if
they had real pride; if they understood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>what it was to smart under a wrong until
the pain cried for a sharp revenge. He
shut his teeth on the hard words that came
to him, and after a moment, said quietly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Milly. I can’t wait. I’ve got
to get away. I guess I wasn’t made for
civilization. I guess I don’t fit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They were entering the clearing about
the Ayers’ cabin. Light came through the
window, showing that the fire was being
kept up and that those within were astir.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll watch you inside the door,”
Jimmy said, halting in the path.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Won’t you come in?” she begged.
“You can sleep in Mose’s shake-down in
the loft.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A little shiver passed through him.
“In <i>Mose’s</i> shake-down?” he repeated.
“No, I’m obliged to you just as much. I’ll
trouble you to keep this gun for Marion.
It’s his. I won’t have a chance to return
it.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“Why, Jimmy, you aren’t going into
the woods to-night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why not?” he asked. “Haven’t I
been in the woods at night before this?
Run in, now. Good night, Milly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl stood, helpless against the
bitterness in his guarded voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good night, Milly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good night,” she faltered. “Oh,
Jimmy, it’s perfectly terrible for you to
go——.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She moved slowly towards the door.
He watched her indistinct figure blend into
the shadow of the cabin wall. Then the
door opened, letting a flood of light across
the snow. Mrs. Ayer stood in the doorway
a moment while Milly said something to
her, and then she called:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jimmy Claiborne, come in this minute,
child!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy slipped behind a tree.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jimmy?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Still he made no answer. The warmth
and the sight of the two women waiting
for him, with nothing but kindness and
tenderness in their hearts, moved him
strangely. He was so unused to it. But
he did not answer, and after waiting a
moment longer they stepped back inside
and the door shut them from his sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>Choking down something that smarted
in his throat, he strode away from the
clearing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Twenty minutes later he had reached
the Claiborne home cabin. He knocked
sharply on the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me in,” he shouted. “Ma!
It’s me. I want to get my gun.”</p>

<p class='c011'>No answer came from within. He
pounded with both fists. “Ma!” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c011'>After awhile he realized that his mother
must be awake, and he changed his voice
from a shout to a conversational tone. “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>only want my gun,” he said, persuasively.
“There’s been a big fire at the shipyard,
and all our whisky’s burned up. Let me
in and I’ll tell you about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He began to narrate the events of the
night, taking heart as he heard a slight stir
inside the cabin. He talked on, apparently
telling the story to the panel of the thick,
treenail-studded door. When he had
finished he repeated his petition, “I only
want my gun, Ma.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The one window opened a crack and
something struck Jimmy on the head. It
was a powder horn. Then his gun came
rattling after it, and the window shut decisively.
Jimmy picked up his gun.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope Uncle Amasa don’t calculate to
come back to-night,” he reflected. “I guess
Ma didn’t like his going off like that to the
fire and leaving the cabin unprotected. But la,
it would be a brave Indian that would break
into Ma’s cabin when she didn’t want him to.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>With his gun in his arm he felt himself
again. He struck briskly into the woods,
following paths as familiar to him as the
roads about the settlement. Nothing stirred
the deep loneliness—but he was not lonely.
He crossed the Ayers’ tract, the four hundred
acres belonging to the Lincolns, the
Hoyts’ improved lands, crossed a branch of
the river and entered the unbroken timber.
There was almost no wind. The frosty air
still gave no hint of morning, and the
occasional breaks in the trees showed a sky
brilliantly crowded with stars.</p>

<p class='c011'>The anger died slowly out of him. If
he had turned back it would have flamed
up again; but, as he drew steadily away from
the scene of his wounded pride, his wrongs
seemed to be left behind and he felt only
the drowsiness of his long tramp. He
would have been glad to crawl into the
hollow of a rotten tree, but he was too
wary, and he held on, crunching through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the untrodden snow, his feet moving in a
sort of rhythm with the unformed thoughts
that kept moving in his brain. The dim
knowledge that it was good to be away
from other human beings, who disapproved
of his restlessness—for Jimmy’s outbreaks
were always the result of restlessness—that
it would be good to creep a little further
into the wilderness, where the white men
had never yet trod, and that this was what
made Uncle Amasa dwell wistfully on the
past when he had been a pioneer in the
territory—all this and more slipped through
his thoughts. The spell of the wilderness
was on him, and he looked forward to the
days he would spend in the hut, watching
his traps and collecting pelts for the ark to
take down to New Orleans. His face grew
hard again as the thought of the ark crossed
his mind. His fist clenched.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll pay them,” he muttered.</p>

  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/i078.jpg' width='200' height='211' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
As Jimmy began to approach
his own cabin a long,
mournful howl reached
him and he threw
up his head like an animal,
scenting danger.</p>

<p class='c011'>More howls. He
stood motionless, listening. For a moment
there was silence, and then the howling
began again. It was not growing nearer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Timber wolves,” he muttered. “It’s
been a hard winter and they’re coming
nearer the settlements. I wonder what
they’re after. Sounds as if they were near
the cabin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He went forward briskly. They might
have come about the cabin to see if they
could find anything in the traps. One of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>them might even have tumbled into a
turkey trap. They did not stop howling,
but the howls grew more and more distinct
as Jimmy advanced.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They’re round the cabin, as sure
as judgment,” he said, as he hurried
along. “Some fool trapper’s gone and
jerked some meat up against the wall too
high for them to reach it. Well, I’m not
going to stay outside to favor all the wolves
in Ohio.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was within a hundred yards of the
cabin. He knew it by the fallen maple
that he clambered over, as he had done a
hundred times. The wolves were certainly
at the cabin. Between their howls he
could hear them snarling amongst one
another and scratching like dogs against the
bark-covered walls of the hut.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly he heard a shot. A sharp
howl of rage answered it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s one gone,” he muttered. “That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>fool trapper’s tired of listening to ’em.” He
mechanically fingered his own gun.</p>

<p class='c011'>He listened, expecting to hear another
shot when the trapper had had time to
reload, but there was none. The wolves
were silent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Scared ’em away,” he thought, advancing
cautiously from tree to tree. “If only
he don’t have the idea of shooting me, this
is the time for me to get in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He stopped again. A thrill of horror
shot down his spine. He felt his hand lose
its grip on the rifle. The wolves had
broken out snarling and snapping, but the
sound that sickened him was the cry of a
man in deadly peril. Not a cry for help,
since he could not know that there was
help anywhere to hear. But simply the
cry of a human animal at bay, and then the
thick blows of the gun-butt on the heads
of the attacking wolves.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m coming!” shouted Jimmy, clutching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>his rifle, with more than his own
strength returned to him. “Hold hard
there! I’m coming!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Even after he was close enough to get
a sight on the black mass that snarled and
fought together, he dared not shoot for
fear of hitting the man he was trying to
save. Then he made him out, a taller
shadow than the rest, pinned against
the wall of the cabin, holding off the
wolves with the thick blows of his gun-butt.</p>

<p class='c011'>Aiming at the outer mass, Jimmy
cocked his rifle and fired. Two of the
grotesque shapes sprang high into the air
and fell back dead. There was an immediate
fight over the carcasses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Run round to the back, and push in
the window!” cried Jimmy. “They’ll
be at you again in a minute. Make haste.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can’t move. Leg’s broken.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy gave a cry of dismay.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“Fire into ’em,” said the man against
the wall.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy loaded quickly and fired again.
As the third wolf fell the others drew
away, dragging one of the carcasses with
them. The man against the wall now sent
a bullet after them and they broke into
flight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quick,” said Jimmy, “before they
come back!” He ran to the man and put
a shoulder under his arm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s my good leg,” said the man,
dryly; “come the other side.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, hurry,” said Jimmy. “Here’s
the door. There ought to be a staple
about here. Steady a minute. Land sakes,
man, don’t faint yet. Wait till we’re inside.
So—careful of the sill. Don’t trip.
You’re all right now. Drop down anywhere.
I must get the door fastened. You
can’t strike a light?” He fumbled hurriedly
with the staple and tongue inside the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>door. Then he drew a breath of thankfulness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Queer,” he said, controlling his excitement,
“we haven’t had any wolves here
this winter. Did you bring them with you,
sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the stranger had fainted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy made a light and set a torch
burning in a socket against the wall. Then
he examined the stranger’s broken leg.
Then he looked around the cabin. It was
as bare of restoratives as an empty cornfield.</p>

<p class='c011'>He shook the stranger. “Wake up,”
he said. “You’ve got to tell me what to
do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The man groaned, and finally opened
his eyes and shivered. “Make a fire,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was an unwritten code that whoever
used the cabin would leave wood for the
next comer to start a fire with, and Jimmy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>soon had a blaze crackling. Then, under
the stranger’s direction, and with nothing
more than a couple of splints torn from the
bunks against the wall and some rags of elk-skin
from the man’s coat, Jimmy bound
up the broken leg.</p>

<p class='c011'>A sickly light was coming in at the
little cabin window by the time this
task was finished. The wolves had not
been heard again, but as Jimmy pushed the
door open and looked out, he saw that the
carcasses of the three dead wolves had been
dragged away, leaving only the bloody
traces of their presence in the trampled
snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve a dead horse somewhere down by
the branch,” the stranger said, “and a few
rations. I don’t know if you could find the
place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s all right,” said Jimmy. “I’ve
got some lye hominy hidden here, if no
one’s discovered it.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>He pulled out the corn shucks that
made a mattress for one of the bunks,
lifted a plank and drew out a bag of corn.
From the same recess he brought a long-handled
spider.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’re mighty at home here,” the
stranger commented.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s the only home I’ve got,” said
Jimmy, with sudden fierceness. “It’s
mine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The stranger looked at him curiously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” he said at last, “I’m mighty
glad you happened along just when you did.
I rode by here about sundown, and hailed,
but there was no one here. Then my
horse fell through a hole down by the
branch and broke his neck and my leg, and
it took me the balance of the night to
crawl back here, only to get set on by
those timber wolves. Law, they were
famished.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What were you doing in this piece of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>woods,” Jimmy asked, “so far off the
roads?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just looking round for a chance to
preempt land. I’m on my way down the
river, really. The rest of my party are
about fifty miles below, and I’d calculated
to join ’em, but now I suppose I’m laid up
here for weeks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s too bad,” said Jimmy. “I was
going down the river—going down on a
flatboat, you know, with the fresh. Marion
Royce is getting his ark ready. I was
going with him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And ain’t you goin’?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” said Jimmy, “I ain’t going.
Marion says he don’t trust me.” He wondered
at himself as he said it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The stranger was silent. Jimmy went
out to get water, carrying his loaded gun
in case the wolves came back. They did
not show themselves, however, and he
returned with water, his gun, and a turkey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>frozen solid and covered with a light coat
of snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Found him in one of my traps,” he
explained.</p>

<p class='c011'>The stranger, who had moved over
with Jimmy’s help to one of the bunks,
looked on at the preparations for breakfast
with interest varied by twinges of excruciating
pain. He was a small man, much
bearded, with very blue eyes as sharp as
gimlets. At Marietta Jimmy would have
instinctively avoided him. But the fact
that he had saved the man from a horrible
death, and that the stranger was helpless
with his broken leg, somehow discounted
his intuitions, and he tried to keep him
entertained so that he would forget his
suffering. He told of the way he lived
weeks at a time at the cabin, and trapped
and dressed skins, and it was natural that in
the course of his narrative he should mention
Uncle Amasa, who so often shared his retreat.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“Amasa?” exclaimed the stranger.
“Amasa Claiborne?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s the one,—my grandfather.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The man ripped out an oath. “You
don’t mean it,” he added hastily. “Why,
I knew your grandpa,—why, let me see, it
was all of twenty years ago, I’m thinking.
Yes, that’s what it was. Do you think he
will be coming here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m afraid he won’t. He’s helping
Marion Royce,” answered Jimmy. “There’s
a lot to be done yet, and not enough hands
at Marietta to work the mill.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m sorry to hear that,” said the
stranger. “I’d of liked to see him, I tell
ye.” His voice expressed more relief than
regret, but Jimmy was too busy to notice
it. “Then you’ll be James Claiborne’s
son,” he added. “I’ll be durned.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you know my father?” asked
Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Know your father?” repeated the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>stranger. “Do I know the back of my
hand? Your father and me was together
no longer ago than last spring on the
Natchez trace.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy wheeled round. “What!” he
gasped. “My father—<i>living</i>?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If your father’s Jim Claiborne, son of
old Unc. Amasa, he’s more alive than I
came near being this night gone. What’s
the matter with ye?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy looked squarely into the light
blue eyes. “Then why ain’t he come
back?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t ask me,” said the stranger.
“Mebby he’s not wanted. I guess your
Uncle Amasa would know where to look
if he was sot on it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Uncle Amasa is just pining to slip
away and look for him,” said Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is he going on the flatboat with that
friend of your’n?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Marion thinks he’s too old,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Jimmy. “Besides, he has to stay and take
care of Ma.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your friend seems to be full of prejudices,”
said the stranger, thoughtfully.
“Now, here’s what I’ve got to say. You
can take it or leave it, and welcome.
You’ve done me a turn that I’ll not forget.
No, I ain’t thankin’ ye. But if you want
to look atter me a spell, till I’m on my
legs again, I’ll do this. I’ll take you down
the river till we meet up with my party
and then we’ll join your pappy. Mebby
about that time your friends’ boat will be
getting down the stream, and ye’ll have the
satisfaction of hailing them from Cincinnati,
or one of the settlements along the way.
I’m a stranger to ye, but you’ll have the
liberty of making up your mind without
any pesterin’ from me. Ye’re free to follow
the dictates of your own heart. It’s
but a small return for a man to make,
whose been saved from what ye saved me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>from; and, besides, on the roads two’s safer
than one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The man with the broken leg had done
some quick thinking. He had his own
reasons for wishing to get down the river.
With Jimmy to help and wait on him, he
would be able to start much sooner than
alone. And once among his friends, some
convenient disposal of Jimmy would soon
offer itself. He might even turn him over
to his father. When the stranger said he
knew James Claiborne, he spoke the entire
and absolute truth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d like to see my father, if it’s true,”
said Jimmy, slowly. “I’d go a good ways,
and so would Uncle Amasa. I wish I
could get word to him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And leave me to shift for myself the
time it would take ye to go and come?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I forgot,” said Jimmy, bent over the
steaming hominy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The thing to do,” said the stranger,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“is this: If Uncle Amasa don’t get out
here before we’re ready to leave, write him
a message on the wall that you’ve gone to
find your pappy; then he’ll understand.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A smile flitted over the man’s face, the
first that had shone on it. It was the
smile that a revengeful and unscrupulous
man might wear as he wiped out an old
and bitter score.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I might do that,” said Jimmy, who
had not seen the smile. “That’s a good
idea. But most likely he’ll come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Amasa was busy at the shipyard,
however, and as fear helped on the rapid
setting of the broken leg, the stranger was
able to hobble about on rude crutches within
ten days.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy made a trip over to Marietta for
him, and bought two horses, not without
inward trepidation, for it was no light thing
that he was venturing, even to find a father
whom he had supposed dead.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>“I’ve got my gun,” he reflected.
“Nothing can happen. As long as he’s
crippled he’s my captive, I’m not his.”
But even as he said it he knew that he was
really captive to the man’s helplessness and
dependence on him.</p>

<p class='c011'>His hand shook as he wrote in charcoal
on the rough log of the mantelpiece,</p>

<p class='c012'>“I hev gon after my fathur.</p>
<p class='c015'>“J. C.”</p>

Brush College was
having its long deferred
holiday. The
candy and raisins had
come from Marietta,
and all the young
people of the settlement,
as well as most of the older ones,
had gathered to see the ark off, and celebrate
its departure with unusual festivities.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Amasa was not there. He had
gone to join Jimmy at their little cabin, a
fortnight or so earlier, and had not yet
returned. He was to bring Jimmy with
him. Marion had consented to take him
on the ark.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two bonfires gleamed ruddily on the
creek bank, where a fiddle’s moving strains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>rose and fell, blending to a chorus of joyous
voices and much laughter. Just within the
mouth of Fish Creek, where the swollen
current of the Ohio “backs up” the smaller
stream, lay the ark of 1803, laden with
everything which such craft carried, and
ready to cast off in the morning. The
crew of seventeen hardy fellows had come
together, young frontiersmen, ready to
brave all the perils and hardships of a voyage
of a hundred days, exposed every day of
it to wreck and hostile bullet. New
Orleans was farther away to these pioneer
youths of Ohio than is Australia to us, and
the voyage thither was subject to a hundred
times greater perils. Yet every year an
increasing number of these unwieldy arks
made the long voyage, and the arksmen
rendered a good account of themselves
against all enemies by the way, and steering
warily past snag and shoal, made the
wished-for port, shrewdly trafficked their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>cargoes and, late in the year, got back to
Ohio, Kentucky or Pennsylvania, with
pockets well lined with Spanish gold, and
packs replete with trinkets.</p>

<p class='c011'>For then, as now, the settlers’ wives,
daughters and sweethearts longed for silk
gowns and bonnets à la mode, laced kerchiefs
and jeweled combs; and much hard
work at the pioneer clearings unquestionably
earned them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Ohio was rising, steadily rising,
much as it had risen every spring for thousands
of years previously, much as it has
risen for a hundred years since. Yet, how
unlike the Ohio of the present day it was!</p>

<p class='c011'>Only a few scattered clearings then
notched the virgin forests that stretched
along its banks from Cairo to Pittsburgh.
Cairo, in fact, did not then exist. Louisville
and Cincinnati were but two pioneer
hamlets, hardly known to each other.</p>

<p class='c011'>No steamboat had as yet made the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>shores resound to its whistle; no suspension
bridges spanned the broad stream. Lurking
parties of hostile Indians lay in ambush at
the narrower reaches of the channel; and,
at certain points, still-more-to-be-dreaded
bands of white outlaws had their haunts
and lay in wait to rob the adventurous
“arks” that floated down the river to seek
their distant and only market at the French
city of the Gulf.</p>

<p class='c011'>The river craft of those days were
indeed picturesque, and characteristic, too,
of Yankee skill and ingenuity.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ark, also called the broadhorn,
often of seventy or eighty tons burden, a
hundred feet in length, fifteen or sixteen
feet of beam, was a great rude, home-hewn
craft, usually decked, generally roofed
over, and intended, as its name signified, to
carry a little of everything.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was also the “keel,”—a long,
slim, graceful boat, of from fifteen to thirty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>tons burden, steered by a rudder instead of
the long “sweep” of the ark, and often
propelled up-stream by oars and poles.</p>

<p class='c011'>And even when to these are added the
barges, skiffs and ferry flats, but an inadequate
idea is gained of the number and
variety of these craft; for there were the
horse-boats, having rude paddle-wheels propelled
by horse-power instead of steam, the
cordelle-boats, the floating “smithies,” or
blacksmiths’ boats, the tinman’s boats, the
floating grist mills, the traveling drygoods
stores, that regularly plied up and down this
great waterway, and lastly the brigs and
ships, built at Marietta, that carried cargoes
down to New Orleans and thence passed
out to sea, bound for foreign ports.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rhythmic waves from the turbid, mighty
current, sweeping past the creek mouth,
beat into it at intervals, causing the
heavy ark to rock slowly at its moorings.
Fitfully then could be heard the impatient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>trampling of horses beneath the rough slab
roof forward; a cow lowed for her calf, and
turkeys and chickens “quuttered” drowsily
on their roosts.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fiddle was still going merrily; yet
all the while a sharp-eyed old hunter stood
a little apart from the dancers, watchful as
a sentinel in war time; and within the ring
of the firelight were stacked a dozen or
more well-oiled flint-lock rifles, where they
could be seized at a moment’s notice; for
an attack by the Indians was still among the
possibilities of an evening gathering.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were other cares, however, and
other hopes of a more personal nature; for
ere long the tall young frontiersman whom
the others called “captain,” and who
seemed to be the leading spirit of the
gathering, drew apart from the others, perhaps
to look to the hawsers that held the
ark, for he approached and tried their
tension.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Very soon, however, he was joined by
the handsome girl with whom he had led
the Virginia Reel, and standing in the
flickering shadows of the great trees down
the bank, Marion Royce and Milly Ayer
conversed long and earnestly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The youthful arksman was a good type
of that hardy generation of a century ago,
that laid the foundation for the present
greatness of the middle West. He was the
offspring of pioneer stock from Virginia and
New England, inured to labor, accustomed
to danger, strong of arm, quick of eye,
rough and ready in action, but manly and
honest of heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not yet twenty-two, he had already
made three voyages to New Orleans. The
long and turbid river-way, with its thousand
perils, had grown familiar to him. Not
his courage alone, but his coolness in
danger and his wary carefulness, day and
night, had led his fellows to choose him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>leader and captain for this fourth voyage
on which these pioneer families had staked
so much.</p>

<p><span class='small'>“YOU WILL SURELY COME BACK THEN?”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“It will be a long summer,” said Milly,
soberly. “We shall not hear from you,
perhaps, in all that time. But by September,
Marion,—you will surely come back
then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps, if all goes well”, replied he,
gravely. “But no one at home need fret if
it is October or November. So many
things may hold us back—head winds on
the river, leaks, lending a hand with other
boats; and then the delays of making our
market at New Orleans.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what if it is true that the Spanish
governor will not let you land there?”
Milly questioned. “The men on that
Marietta keel that went up last night told
father so. They said the dons had mounted a
twelve-gun battery on the levee and would
sink the first Yankee boat that comes down.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“That may not be true,” replied Marion,
doubtfully. “But let them try that if they
dare. New Orleans is the front door of
this whole great country, and woe be to
those who try shut it in our faces.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, if there is fighting, do try to keep
out of it, Marion!” exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The fighting would be short,” said the
young man. “Don’t you worry about
that, Milly. They do say Thomas Jefferson
is figuring to buy up that whole country
down there and send the Spaniards home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, father says that savage man,
Napoleon Bonaparte, means to seize this
whole country up the Mississippi for France.
Father says that a French fleet may be at
New Orleans before you get down there,
and that’s the real reason,” Milly continued,
lowering her voice, “why father wouldn’t
send Jerry with the other horses. He is
afraid you will lose them all. And Aunt
Betty Lord is only sending half her winter’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>spinning of yarn—she’s so afraid the French
will get it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion laughed. “There’s cargo
enough without Aunt Betty’s yarn,” said
he. “We’ve never sent so much before,
even though we don’t carry those twenty
barrels of Claiborne peach brandy and
whisky. I’m worried about Uncle Amasa.
He ought to have been back. I’d hate to
have to go without Jimmy, now that everything’s
straightened out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What did Master Hempstead tell you,
Marion?”</p>

<p class='c011'>For she knew that the schoolmaster
had had a long talk with the young captain
on the day following the fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why,” said Marion, “he said that he
was on his way to take toll of the peach
brandy in the shed, when he saw that the
shed was on fire, and he heard the hoofs of
a horse being ridden away at a gallop.
Then Jimmy Claiborne came along and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>accused him of trying to steal their whisky,
and they began fighting. When the master
fell, Jimmy ran away, probably afraid that
he’d killed him. Then, probably, he saw
from the woods that the fire was destroying
everything, and he came back to help.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Master Hempstead said he expected to
be discharged. He felt more humiliated at
having been a disgrace to a noble profession
than from any personal loss of dignity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you persuaded the Committee to
keep him? Oh, Marion, I know you did.
It is just like you,” said Milly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The captain laughed. “Where do you
think we would find another Oxford graduate
to teach in this wilderness? Would
you like to know the quaint way in which
he vindicated himself? He quoted from
Sophocles: ‘He who surpasses his fellow
citizens in wisdom is no longer a member
of the city. Its laws are not for him, since
he is a law unto himself.’”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Milly laughed. “And, meanwhile, the
mystery of who set the fire remains a
mystery?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It remains a mystery,—look yonder,
Milly!” he exclaimed. “If that isn’t Uncle
Amasa! and he’s alone!”</p>

<p class='c011'>They ran back to the scene of the
merrymaking. The dancers had stopped,
and were clustering three deep around the
old pioneer. As Milly and Marion joined
the crowd the fiddles were silenced by a
lifted hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jimmy’s gone!” whispered the listeners,
looking at one another with awed
faces. “Gone—no one knows where. Uncle
Amasa’s spent all this time searching among
the settlements. He found where Jimmy
had passed through on horseback, with
another man, but he never caught up with
them, and he’s given up hope. Jimmy
left a word on the wall of the cabin saying
that he’d <i>gone to find his father</i>!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>As this message passed among the settlers,
their faces grew sober in the firelight.
There was not a soul among them but
believed that Jimmy’s father had been killed
by the Indians, and the message sounded
like an ill omen. Gravely, almost solemnly,
the party broke up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t worry, Uncle Amasa,” said
Marion, moving away with the old man.
“Jimmy can take care of himself. He’s
made for the wilderness. He’ll come
back, or we may pick him up in some town
along the way. He is in no danger that you
haven’t been in and come out of—remember
that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know,” said Uncle Amasa. “I
know; but I’d ruther he had taken his
chances along with ye, and seen some of
the doin’s down to New Orleans. It would
have been a sight safer. There’s been
treachery in this, Marion; there’s been
treachery, or the boy wouldn’t have written
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>that message. It’s uncanny. The lad is
being led to his death.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No such thing,” said Marion, stoutly.
But his heart misgave him, and he determined
to watch closely, as he went down
the river, for the runaway.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c011'>Daybreak saw the clumsy craft with its
heterogeneous cargo float slowly forth from
the shadows of the creek mouth to the tune
of a mighty creaking of its great sweeps,
till it was caught by the river current outside,
and the long trip of two thousand
miles began.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the river running five or six miles
an hour, it would seem that a hundred
miles a day might be made; but snags and
shifting mud banks rendered it hazardous
to float by night, save when the moon was
full. Slack water, too, at the numerous
bends, and the necessity of frequently crossing
over to avoid islands and rafts of drift,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>consumed much time, so that often twenty
miles in a day was as much as could be accomplished
with a due regard for safety.</p>

<p class='c011'>They tied up the first night in a creek
mouth on the Virginia bank, fifteen miles
below Blennerhassett’s Island, having spent
an hour there, viewing the mansion and the
flower gardens.</p>

<p class='c011'>For this beautiful island, so sadly associated
with the early history of the Ohio,
was then in the heyday of its prosperity.
Harman Blennerhassett and his accomplished
wife had come there five years
previously, and wonderful accounts of their
luxurious home, their wealth and culture
had spread up and down the two great
rivers, from Pittsburgh to New Orleans.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ark made good progress during the
next day and the day following. By three
o’clock of this third afternoon it reached
Letart’s “Falls.” Here the sweeps were
double-manned, and the boat was about to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>run down this bit of quick water when the
sudden onset of a thunder-squall led Marion
Royce to countermand his order, and pole
the ark to the shelter of the trees on an
island just above the rapids.</p>

<p class='c011'>The delay bade fair to be brief, but it
was fraught with grave consequences.
While lying-by there, waiting for the gust
of rain to spend itself, Shadwell Lincoln
espied a new barge on rough timber ways,
masked by cedar shrubbery, upon the Virginia
side of the river. The wind and rain,
waving the cedar aside, gave them glimpses
of it, otherwise it would have escaped
notice.</p>

<p class='c011'>They hailed it, but received no answer.
Moses Ayer then fired his rifle to attract
the attention of those ashore. At the report
a flock of buzzards rose from close by the
barge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s queer,” said Lewis Hoyt.
“Let’s have a look at that barge, Cap’n.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Marion nodded. Lewis and Moses Ayer
climbed into the small skiff, which the ark
towed astern, and pulled into the bank, distant
no more than a hundred yards. Landing
a little above the barge, they pushed
through a tangled thicket of cedar and
wild grape-vines, and disappeared from
view; but Moses soon came off again
in haste.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis a new fifty-foot barge,” he
exclaimed, “and four men have been at
work on her—but they will never do any
more work!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why not?” said the captain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Cause they’re dead and scalped!”
replied the boy, his dark young eyes dilating
with suppressed excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Redskins!” muttered several of the
crew.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, how long ago?” questioned
Marion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just done!” cried Moses.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Captain Royce cast a hasty glance alongshore,
and then toward the thick trees of
the island, in the shadow of which they
were lying.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you sure? The rain would freshen
the signs,” he said. “Are you very sure—and
why did not Lewis come off with you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’s watching!” exclaimed Mose.
“He said he would watch while I came
off to tell you. There’s a path leads back
from the barge to three cabins and a clearing.
We smelled smoke from the cabins.
Lewis said he would watch them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But if redskins are about they heard
you fire”, said Marion. “Stand by, to pole
off, men.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, after another searching glance
alongshore, he jumped into the skiff himself
and rowed hurriedly to the shore to
fetch Lewis aboard. He knew Indians
well, and feared that they were lying in
wait to capture the ark.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>As the skiff touched the bank he
whistled twice, the signal for calling a man
ashore. Apparently Lewis did not hear.
After waiting a minute or two, Captain
Royce landed cautiously, to see for himself
how recently the attack had been made,
but had scarcely forced his way through
the cedar to the little yard of chips and
hewings about the barge, when he heard a
shot close at hand, and thought also that he
heard Lewis running.</p>

<p class='c011'>The echoes of the shot had hardly
ceased from the wooded side of the opposite
island, however, when a volley appeared
to be fired over there, and was followed by
the peculiar quavering yell of the Shawnees!</p>

<p class='c011'>A skulking war party had surprised the
unfortunate builders of the barge. Beyond
doubt, too, the Indians had seen the ark
crossing over, and all through the shower
had been lying in wait in the woods on the
island.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Caught at such a disadvantage, Marion
Royce justified his reputation for coolness
in danger and good judgment. His first
anxiety was for his ark and crew. Bounding
through the cedar and vines, he hailed
the startled crew, calling sharply to them
to shove off instantly and not wait for him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You, Merrick, Lincoln, Gist, shove
off! Get her into the current!” he shouted.
“I’ll catch you in the skiff! Shove off!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Indians were firing shot after shot;
and five or six of the savages, hideously
painted, dashed out from the bank through
the shallows, to board the ark. Gist fell
overboard, shot while pushing hard with his
pole. Merrick was also slightly wounded.
But the boat was off, and immediately the
strong current that made round the foot of
the island bore the heavy craft away and
into the rapids below.</p>

<p class='c011'>As soon as they were afloat the arksmen
dropped to cover behind the thick planks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>of the rail, and crawling to the gun-room
amidships, secured their rifles. Moses Ayer
and Shadwell Lincoln stood by the sweeps
to keep her head with the stream.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ark was now out of danger of capture;
and, observing this, her plucky young
captain took thought for his own safety and
that of Lewis Hoyt. Twice he shouted to
the boy, but the only answer was several
rifle bullets from the redskins on the island.
Three canoes put out, noticing which,
Marion was constrained to ply his oars to
escape down the rapids. By dint of vigorous
exertion he overtook the ark two miles
below. It was not till he had got on board
that he learned of the loss of Gist, whom
none of the crew expected ever to see
again.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lewis was running down the Virginia
shore, keeping the ark in sight. The boy
hailed them from the bank about a mile
below, and was taken aboard in the skiff.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>He had been fired at, but was unhurt.
Gist, they had little doubt, had been killed
or was drowned.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a profound gloom for his loss, the
arksmen continued their voyage.</p>

<p class='c011'>What they did not know, and could not
guess, was that they left behind them
another member of the crew.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy Claiborne had been floating
down the river in a canoe, waiting to be
picked up by the ark, when he had been
captured by these same Shawnees.</p>

The adventure of Louis
Gist was indeed a singular
one. He had set his
pole in the sandy bottom
to help push the ark off,
and he and Merrick and
Kenton were pushing
hard together when a
bullet from one of their
Indian assailants ashore broke the setting-pole
between his hands, and, penetrating
his deerskin jacket, struck a rib,
which it also broke. But the lead was
deflected, and passing half round his body
beneath the skin, lodged there as a little
blue lump against a rib on the other side!</p>

<p class='c011'>The breaking of the pole and the shock
caused him to pitch overboard; and, as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>was but an indifferent swimmer, he would
probably have drowned then and there had it
not been for a strong eddy of the current
at the foot of Letart’s Island. This eddy
swept him round with it like a bit of
flotsam, and lodged him in shallower
water, amid clots of foam and driftwood.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here his knees touched bottom and he
got his head up. He thought himself
mortally wounded, for the shock of the
bullet directly over his heart had been
heavy. Moreover, he was in great pain
and bleeding considerably, and in this predicament
he seemed partially or wholly to
have lost consciousness.</p>

<p class='c011'>When at length he came to himself, he
had a confused impression that there had
been a terrible battle, that the ark had been
taken, and all his late companions killed.</p>

<p class='c011'>By this time it had grown dusk, and he
heard, or thought that he heard, the Indians
on the other side of the island. The ark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>had already passed down the rapids and was
out of sight; but Gist fancied that the redskins
had towed it round to the Virginia
side of the island.</p>

<p class='c011'>After awhile he crawled out to the
water on the Ohio side of the island, and
made his way through the brushwood up to
the head of it. Here he lay all night, in
great misery; but early the next morning
he saw a skiff with four men coming down
the river, and was able to attract their
attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>They took him with them as far as the
settlement at the mouth of the Scioto,
where a pioneer surgeon laid open the little
blue lump on his rib with a hunting-knife,
and extracted the Indian bullet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Three or four weeks later he was able
to work his passage back up the river on a
Wheeling flatboat, and told the people at
home that the ark was captured by the
Indians, and that to the best of his knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>and belief, he, of all her crew, was
the sole survivor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such endings of the early efforts of
commerce and travel on the Ohio were of
too frequent occurrence to render the tale
incredible; and, although some had their
doubts, most of the settlers believed that
Gist’s account was but too likely to be true.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus far no such overwhelming disaster
had befallen the little pioneer settlement at
Fish Creek.</p>

<p class='c011'>In very truth there were sorrow and
mourning at every cabin, and especially in
those of the Royce and Ayer families. To
Milly Ayer and Mary Royce the year 1803
bade fair to be the saddest of their young
lives.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the stout ark all the while was floating
bravely on—past the mouth of the
Kanawha, where, in 1749, the ambitious
Céleron buried his leaden plates, asserting
the claim of France to the entire Ohio
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Valley; past Point Pleasant, where, in 1774,
General Lewis and his rangers fought a
fierce, indecisive battle all day with the
famous Shawnee chief, Cornstalk, and his
braves; past the mouth of the Big Sandy,
near which a gigantic railroad bridge now
spans the broad river; past the Scioto mouth,
where Portsmouth, Ohio, then showed only
a few scattered cabins; and so onward till,
after nine days, they had come to that little
town on the beautiful bluffs now known the
world over as Cincinnati.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cincinnati is said to have been christened
Losantiville, in 1788, by the first
schoolmaster of that region, one John
Filson, whom the Indians subsequently
scalped. From the depths of his classical
erudition Filson manufactured the name to
fit the location, namely: <i>L</i> for Licking
River, <i>os</i> for mouth of the same, <i>anti</i> for
opposite, and <i>ville</i> for town—The-town-opposite-the-mouth-of-the-Licking.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>It was customary for arks’ crews to have
a “liberty day” at the embryo metropolis,
but on this occasion Marion Royce dissuaded
his fellows from stopping there longer than
was necessary to make sure that there was
no trace in the town of Jimmy Claiborne.
They tied up for the night to the Kentucky
bank, a little below where Covington now
stands, and the next day floated down
to the mouth of Big Bone Creek.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Ohio was still rising, the current
waxing stronger and more rapid each day.
Thus far the ark had tied up only by night,
but her young captain had a particular
reason for stopping at this point.</p>

<p class='c011'>During his previous visits to New
Orleans Marion had met many odd characters
along the levees, among others a
certain French doctor and savant, named
Buchat, who was vastly interested in the
natural history of the New World, and
after an odd fashion of his own was incessantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>questioning the hunters and boatmen
who came down the great river. The latter
generally considered him crack-brained;
but Marion understood him better, and
liked the vivacious old gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Buchat had heard of the huge
skeletons of mastodons (then called mammoths)
which had been found by the settlers
in the Ohio Valley, and was very curious
concerning the localities where they were
discovered. Marion Royce, who had once
ascended Big Bone Creek for game, gave
the old Frenchman such information as he
was able concerning the size of the thighbones,
vertebræ and skulls which he had
seen in the basin of the Lick.</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion’s account so fired the enthusiasm
of the collector that he offered the young
man a thousand francs if he would unearth
a skeleton of one of these huge creatures
and fetch it down the river on his next
trip.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>A thousand francs—about two hundred
dollars—was a sum not to be despised in
those days of small means, especially by a
young pioneer who was contemplating a
home of his own in the near future. Marion
had determined to win this, if it could be
done without jeopardy to the ark and
cargo.</p>

<p class='c011'>Big Bone Creek is but a very small
affluent of the Ohio, little more than a
brook, in fact. It enters from the Kentucky
shore through a fringe of willows,
between low, sugar-loaf hills, then densely
wooded by lofty sycamore and walnut. At
low water boats could ascend this creek;
but now the rising current set back into the
mouth of it for a distance of fully two
miles.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wood-wise and wary, the young ark’s
captain tied up to the Kentucky shore, two
miles above the creek mouth, and sent
Kenton round about through the woods to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>reconnoiter the lick. For, as it was a place
frequented by deer and elk, it had come
also to be a place of ambush for the stealthy
redskins.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kenton came upon the ashes of a campfire,
two or three days old, on one of the
hills overlooking the lick, and concluded
that Indians had recently been watching
there. The presence of a large herd of
deer about the springs, however, convinced
him that they had gone away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very early the next morning, therefore,
the ark dropped down to the creek mouth
and was poled up through the slack water
for a distance of nearly two miles. But to
guard against surprise, it was moored out
in the stream, instead of being tied to the
bank, by driving down three setting-poles,
so as to give forty feet of open water all
around it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shadwell Lincoln, with seven of the
crew, including young Moses Ayer and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Lewis Hoyt, was left in charge. Marion
himself, with the others, set off for the lick,
provided with axes and a shovel. From
where the ark lay they had not far from
two miles to go, through the forest and
over hills.</p>

<p class='c011'>Big Bone Creek is peculiar in that it
comes almost wholly from five or six
copious sulphur and saline springs, which
issue from the earth in the marshy basin
above mentioned.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the first white hunters came here
in 1729 the whole marsh bristled with
enormous white bones—hence the name.
Naturalists and collectors have now carried
off everything in sight; but those who
have patience to excavate the marsh are able
occasionally to unearth bones of amazing
magnitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1803, however, it was still possible
to find partly buried skeletons intact, or
nearly so. Marion Royce and his arksmen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>had not long to search for one, and were
soon busy at their strange task.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Royce and Ayer family traditions
have it that the arksmen dug out a huge
mammoth skeleton here, and were occupied
until May 3 hauling it down to the ark
on bob-sleds, which they constructed for
the purpose. Many of the great molar
teeth and numbers of the small bones were
missing from this and all other skeletons
found here; but, by overhauling several
different skeletons, they were able to make
up these deficiencies in part.</p>

<p class='c011'>Like the deer, elk and buffalo, the
mastodon was a constitutionally salt-hungry
herbivore. Great numbers of them, venturing
into the soft marsh about these saline
springs, were “mired” and perished miserably,
either from hunger or the attacks of
the carnivora.</p>

<p class='c011'>For centuries the numerous “licks” of
this Western wilderness were veritable death
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>traps for the larger game. Not only were
the heavy buffalo and heavier mastodon
bogged in the treacherous salt sloughs, but
the deer and elk were constantly preyed on
by panthers, wolves, and Indian hunters
that had learned to ambush these localities.</p>

<p class='c011'>The mouth of the Big Bone was now
near to being a trap for the ark. An immense
raft of driftwood had set into it from
the rising current of the Ohio outside. For
a mile below where the ark lay the creek
was rilled by it, and so dense was the pack
that it became a question whether the crew
would be able to force a passage through it
to the open river.</p>

<p class='c011'>Otherwise, that part of the crew left
aboard were passing dull days, particularly
the two boys, Moses and Lewis; for Captain
Royce had left strict orders with
Shadwell Lincoln that while he was absent
at the lick the men must remain closely
aboard, and be constantly on guard against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>a surprise by Indian war parties, a precaution
necessary from the exposed position of the
ark in the narrow creek.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the weather had now turned warm,
and the lagoon, overhung by great trees,
was like a hothouse. A flock of buzzards
hung about them, often alighting among
the poultry on the roof of the ark. Hawks
and a pair of eagles also troubled them, and
by night a large owl paid them visits.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moses and Lewis longed to go ashore
and hunt, but true to his orders Lincoln
would not allow it. A little sport offered,
shooting turkey gobblers, numbers of which,
allured by the plaintive “yeapings” of the
turkeys aboard the ark, appeared on the
creek bank. One ambitious young gobbler
flew out to them of his own accord, and
began “strutting” on the roof.</p>

<p class='c011'>The morning before the captain and his
party returned with their sled-loads of
bones a more exciting incident occurred,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>which well illustrates the perils that beset
the daily life of the pioneers.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little after daybreak, while still most
of the crew were asleep, another turkey-cock
was heard gobbling in the woods a
little way back from the creek bank. First
Moses, then Lewis, rifle in hand, sat watching
behind the plank bulwarks. There
was rivalry between them as to which
should first catch sight of these wild
visitors.</p>

<p class='c011'>For some time they heard the bird
gobbling at intervals of a few minutes; but
this particular turkey-cock appeared to be
wary and disinclined to show himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, at length, Moses noted an odd
circumstance, and drew suddenly down to
cover of the planking.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lay up, Lew!” said he. “I believe
that’s a redskin!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Gobbling like a turkey in the woods, to
lure the white settlers near enough for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>shot, was a common stratagem with the
Indians in those days—one that cost more
than one pioneer his scalp. Some of the
savages were adepts at imitating all the
notes of the wild turkey, from the plaintive
“yeap-yeap, yop-yop” of the hens, to the
noisy, defiant gobble of the big, bronze-breasted,
red-wattled turkey-cocks.</p>

<p class='c011'>The human ear could detect nothing
wrong with this call; perhaps the ear of a
turkey is keener, for what Moses Ayer had
noted was that their own turkeys were not
responding as usual to this early caller.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Lewis believed it was a turkey, so
many had come out in sight there. The
two boys argued it for some time, and
meantime the gobbling continued at intervals,
apparently about a gun-shot back from
the creek.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not only Charles Hoyt, but Merrick
and Wistar Royce, Marion’s brother, who
had now appeared from their bunks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>thought that it was probably a turkey.
Lewis declared that he would go ashore to
shoot it, but Lincoln forbade it, although
he, too, believed it to be a bird.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moses still insisted that it was a skulking
Indian trying to pick up a scalp, and
the discussion and banter waxed so hot at
length that the boy determined, privately,
to prove himself in the right.</p>

<p class='c011'>He seemed to retire to his bunk, as if
for another nap, but made his way astern,
past the horses. Here he let out the painter
line that held the skiff sufficiently to allow
him to reach the bank in it, and then,
watching his chance, while the others were
washing up and preparing breakfast, effected
a landing unobserved, but on the bank opposite
where he had heard the turkey gobble.</p>

<p class='c011'>Concealing himself in the laurel boughs,
he carefully reprimed his rifle and lay quiet
till he had heard the turkey again. Thereupon,
feeling tolerably certain that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Indian—if it were one—had not seen him
land, he made a wide detour through the
forest and crossed the creek at a point
where the stream was shallow, half a mile
above where the ark lay. From here he
worked his way cautiously down the other
bank, crawling from one thicket to another,
with a stealth which even an Indian might
have envied.</p>

<p class='c011'>But now the youthful woodsman was at
a disadvantage. The “gobbling” of the
suppositious turkey-cock had ceased. With
that to guide him he could easily have
located the “gobbler.” For the first time
he felt afraid. Either the Indian had
sighted him, and was waiting for him to
come nearer, or else had grown tired of the
effort and gone away.</p>

<p class='c011'>For half an hour or more the boy lay
still in the brush, watching and listening,
not daring to stir a twig. He was already
within two hundred yards of where the ark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>lay, but young cane, vines and other brush
made thick cover all along the bank.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fortune favored him at length, otherwise
he would not have dared to make
another move. Down the bank, almost
opposite the ark, a pair of redbirds suddenly
began making a fuss, as they do when their
nests are disturbed; a catbird also uttered
its low, squalling note. Some enemy was
disturbing the birds there, and with a good
notion that it might be the Indian, Moses
now crept slowly nearer.</p>

<p class='c011'>All the while he could hear plainly the
voices of the men on the ark and smell the
smoke of their morning pipes. Lewis and
Charles Hoyt were talking and laughing.
He heard the latter say that he—Moses—had
got the sulks and gone to his bunk!</p>

<p class='c011'>The redbirds continued scolding. He
could see them flying about over a laurel
clump, and crawling still nearer, he presently
detected a slight movement of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>canes near an old heap of driftwood, within
a few yards of the creek water and not
more than a hundred feet distant. Keeping
his eyes fixed on the spot, he presently saw
a feathered scalp-lock rise slowly there—for
a peep at the ark!</p>

<p class='c011'>The sight sent a curious thrill along the
boy’s nerves, and for some moments he lay
very quiet. Then, plucking up his courage,
he looked yet again to his priming and
crawled a little nearer. He could see the
Indian more clearly now, and distinguished
his ear, shoulder and tawny right arm, with
its dull brass armlet. Eager, but silent as a
crouching panther, the Indian was watching
the ark and listening to the voices of the
men.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moses, too, could discern as well as
hear them, and it made his heart beat
quickly to see Charles Hoyt walk unconcernedly
aft, his head and shoulders fully
exposed above the planking of the bulwarks;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>for he knew now that the lurking savage,
unable to lure any of the arksmen ashore,
had crawled down to the bank with the
intention of shooting at least one of the
whites, then making his escape.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, help water the horses!” he
heard Hoyt call out; and then Lewis and
Merrick lounged aft, an easy mark for the
concealed savage, who was hardly more
than twenty yards away.</p>

<p class='c011'>This feeling of suspense and apprehension
for his companions changed to something
akin to horror when he saw Wistar
Royce swing himself up by a stanchion to
the roof of the ark and move about, feeding
and watering the poultry in their cages up
there. Surely the Indian could not hope
for a fairer mark!</p>

<p class='c011'>Apparently the latter thought so himself,
for the boy saw him raise the long
barrel of a rifle into view and slide it
slowly across a log of the drift heap.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>For some seconds Moses had been holding
his own rifle in readiness to shoot. It
was his first experience stalking an Indian,
however, and he felt not a little afraid. If
he missed his aim, the redskin would no
doubt return the shot on the instant, or
else rush upon him with knife and tomahawk
before he could reload.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the sight of the savage making
ready to fire at Wistar served to renew his
courage, and he cautiously cocked his rifle.</p>

<p class='c011'>At so little a distance, however, the
savage heard the click of the hammer. He
glanced suddenly in Moses’ direction. Their
eyes met as the boy fired. Through the
smoke he saw the Indian leap to his feet
with a frightful whoop, and dropping his
own empty rifle, he darted back through
the underbrush to escape. But he immediately
perceived that the savage was down,
writhing about and making distressful
sounds. But even these movements wholly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>ceased before Moses had his rifle reloaded,
for his bullet had entered near the Indian’s
right armpit and passed completely through
his body.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile the shot had produced a
considerable commotion on the ark. The
crew seized their guns to repel an attack.
Moses’ absence was immediately discovered,
however, and seeing the skiff at the other
bank, the men at once concluded that he
had gone ashore to shoot the turkey. Shadwell
Lincoln hailed him by name, and
fearing lest the arksmen might fire on him in
the brush, Moses was constrained to answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come aboard, you young scamp!”
shouted Lincoln. Bidding Wistar and
Lewis haul the skiff round, he went ashore
after Moses himself, being minded to give
the boy a “wigging” for disobeying orders.
“Come aboard, you scamp!” he shouted
again. “Did you not hear me tell you not
to go ashore after that gobbler?”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>But Moses, who had by this time
possessed himself of the Indian’s rifle, knife
and feather-bedecked head-dress, stepped
proudly out of the brush in full view of
them all, and holding up his trophies, said,
“Here’s your turkey gobbler!”</p>

On the same morning that
Moses Ayer shot the
“gobbler,” Marion Royce
and his men came down
from Big Bone Lick with
their four sled loads of
mammoth bones. The ark, however,
was blockaded for a week by
the dense pack or raft of driftwood, which
had set back from the Ohio into the creek
mouth.</p>

<p class='c011'>As long as the river continued to rise,
the drift pack was forced back into the
slack water with an increasing pressure
which defied the efforts of the crew to open
a passage through it. On the eighth night,
however, the “fresh,” as rivermen term
rising water, slackened and fell a few inches,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>when immediately, as from a magic touch,
the densely jammed pack loosened and
began floating out into the river.</p>

<p class='c011'>By dint of poling hard the men got out
of the Big Bone early on the morning of
the ninth day, and resumed their voyage.
That afternoon they passed Vevay, where
newly arrived Swiss settlers were beginning
to erect log houses and clear land for vineyards.</p>

<p class='c011'>A bright moon enabled them to go on
that evening, and early in the night they
passed the mouth of the Kentucky. By
the next noon Sand Island was sighted, and
here Captain Royce tied up to take a look
at the rapid water ahead; for the ark had
reached the “Falls of the Ohio,” now made
easy for ascending steamers by the canal.</p>

<p class='c011'>La Salle, the famous early explorer of
Western rivers, is said to have been here in
1669, and tradition tells of various efforts
to maintain forts and found a settlement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>here during the tumultuous eighteenth
century warfare. In May of 1778, George
Rogers Clark was here and built a log
blockhouse on Corn Island, in the midst of
the rapids. But even as late as 1803 only a
few scattered houses could be discerned
alongshore from the river.</p>

<p class='c011'>The falls here are the only real obstruction
to navigation on the Ohio, and like
most of the so-called “falls” of Western
rivers, are more formidable in name
than in reality. At low water the rapids
are dangerous to inexperienced boatmen,
but when the Ohio is in flood, hardly a
ripple breaks the swift current.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a cautious look ahead, Captain
Royce double-manned the sweeps and ran
the quick water without other incident
than an acceleration of the ark’s progress.</p>

<p class='c011'>The life of an arksman floating down
the Ohio and Mississippi was an easy one
when all went well, yet subject hourly to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>most perilous contingencies. Beyond manning
the sweeps, the crew had little to do,
save to prepare their food and care for their
live stock.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the first six days after passing
the falls the ark made unusually good progress,
the moonlight enabling Captain
Royce to continue during at least a part of
four of the nights. They passed the then
uncleared site of Evansville and of Henderson,
not yet the home of the naturalist,
Audubon, and threading the great “oxbows”
of the river, came where the
mighty Wabash, flowing down past old
Vincennes, poured its grand stream of clear,
green water out across the roily Ohio.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the last of these nights, Moses was
standing at the great steering oar, his gaze
fixed curiously on the high bluffs beside
which the ark was passing. Somewhere at
the bow he supposed that Lewis was swinging
his feet and thinking pretty much the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>same thoughts as Moses himself. The
great boat with all its freight was wrapped
in utter silence. Hours ago, it seemed to
Mose, the cocks had awakened the echoes
of the shore with their drowsy “oo—oo——oo——OO,”
and tucked their heads under
their wings again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These must be the palisades Marion
talked about,” Mose reflected. Marion had
told him to call him if they were reached
before daybreak, for it would mean that
they were passing along the Illinois shore,
through the region of the cave robbers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The high limestone cliffs were gray in the
moonlight, but here and there Moses saw
deep black fissures, the entrances of caves.
Remembering his orders, he called to Lewis.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lew! Oh Lew! Ahoy the bow!”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Must have dropped asleep,” Moses
said to himself. He put his fingers into
his mouth and whistled shrilly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>In a moment half a dozen men had
come running to the deck.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s happened? What’s the
matter? Where’s Lewis?” they asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Asleep, I guess,” said Mose. “Here’s
the cliffs, Cap’n.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion Royce looked uneasily at the
peaceful face of the moonlit palisades. As
the ark floated past, close in shore, the
crew stood at the starboard rail, speculating
as to the extent of the caverns. Suddenly
a voice called from the water behind them,
and they saw an arm upraised.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s Lewis!” exclaimed Marion.
“Throw a line out, Kenton!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Lewis caught the line without trouble
and the men soon had him aboard, dripping
and excited.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bad stretch of water to bathe in,
Lewis,” said the captain, gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I didn’t mean to fall in,” said Lewis.
“A canoe stole past to port of us, and before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>I could cry out an Indian had slipped up
behind me and shoved me into the water,
but I took him with me. When we came
up to the surface someone in the canoe
reached out to us, but instead of pulling us
in I saw a knife flash and the Indian who
had pulled me overboard went down without
a gurgle, cut through the throat. I dived
under, for I didn’t want to make any closer
acquaintance with the Indian in the canoe.
Then I came up, and here I am. Where’s
the canoe?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must have put into one of the
caves,” said the captain. “What I can’t
understand is how it could have happened
without Moses hearing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was looking at the palisades,” said
Mose. “It all happened at the bow,
ninety feet away. By the time the ark had
floated its own length it was all over.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go down and get dry clothes, Lewis,”
ordered the captain. “Keep a sharp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>watch, the rest of you. There is something
extraordinary about this—two Indians
in a canoe try to murder the watch aboard
an ark, and the second Indian, instead of
doing his part and killing the steersman as
the ark drifts by, knifes the first Indian. I
never heard of such a thing. Are you sure
you weren’t dreaming when you fell overboard?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dreaming?” chattered Lewis, stopping
on his way to the cabin. “Look at
that!”</p>

<p class='c011'>They wheeled and stared behind them.
Around a small jutting ledge an empty
canoe was drifting towards them, dancing
giddily in the ark’s shining wake. Almost
as they looked a shot rang out from a cave
that they were passing and John Cutler,
one of the oldest men of the crew, lurched
into Kenton’s arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Veer off shore,” ordered the captain,
quietly. “Steady—the sweeps. MacAfee,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>stand by ready to catch that canoe.
Careful with the oar. Don’t upset the
canoe with it. Steady—steady with the
sweeps—back water all you can. Shad
Lincoln, stand by to help MacAfee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aren’t we going back to kill the
Indian that shot Cutler?” indignantly asked
Kenton, as he saw the ark swing away from
the shore.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not here,”, said the captain. “Too
rocky—can’t land. Is John badly wounded?
Take him into the cabin. I’ll be in and
dress it as soon as we’re by these caves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m all right,” said Cutler, raising
himself by Kenton’s help.  “Better hold
right on, Marion. There may be a party—may
have fired just to draw us into a trap.”
He swayed, and tottered into the cabin.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We <i>shall</i> go back!” cried Charlie
Hoyt, savagely. “Cutler, too, of all of us!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’ll scalp every one we can lay hold
of!” added Moses, hotly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Their blood was boiling. It was all
that the young captain could do to preserve
order. But his voice was quiet and his
tone so commanding that it cowed them.
They were crouched under the rail, all
excepting those who were obliged to stand
exposed at the sweeps, and MacAfee, who
was coolly trolling for the dancing canoe.
Another shot followed them, but fell
short.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They’re all back there in that cave,”
said Lincoln, in his slow, deliberate way.
“It must irk them to see you fishin’ for
their war canoe and not be able to pot you.
Let me take a turn, MacAfee; maybe I can
catch it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let the canoe go,” called Marion.
“It’s not worth getting shot for.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But MacAfee had deftly secured his
prize, and the weighted spear which he
had thrown stuck quivering in the bottom
of the light craft. He drew in his line
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>cautiously, and then Lincoln helped him
take the canoe aboard.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here’s news,” drawled Lincoln. He
held up an unfolded sheet of paper. MacAfee
snatched it from him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was in the bottom of the canoe,
weighted with a stone,” Lincoln explained.
“That Indian that knifed Lewis’s Indian
seems to be friendly to all of us, sending us
messages on a letter stolen from a murdered
courier, apparently.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush up, Linc. Someone get a light.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In the lee of the rail they pored over
the paper, which might not, after all, be
meant for them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s written in blood!” cried Moses.</p>

<p class='c011'>It held only one word, traced with the
writer’s forefinger, and that word was—DANGER.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wait!” said Mose. “Isn’t that an
initial, straggled there?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was wonderin’ if you’d any of you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>see that,” said Lincoln. “I saw it the first
thing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are two of them,” said Marion,
controlling his excitement with a great
effort. “Look, Lincoln, do you make out
what I do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I expect so. I make out a ‘J. C.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“J. C.!” repeated Moses. He stared
from Marion to Lincoln, and back to
Lewis, who stood trembling as if he had
taken a chill. “Why——do you suppose
that’s meant for Jimmy Claiborne?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The light of the cabin lantern which
they had brought out showed their awed,
startled faces. “I think it is,” began
Marion, slowly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hey——you,” he cried, looking up;
“man the sweeps! We’re getting too far
out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But the man in the canoe was an
Indian,” objected Lewis, “and he must
have sent the message. He barely had time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>to write it with the blood that spurted
over him from cutting the Indian’s throat.
Ough! I just saw it spout up as I went
down.” He gave a great shiver at the
memory that would haunt him while he
lived.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The man in that canoe was Jimmy
Claiborne,” said the captain. “I’m sorry,
men. We can’t land, now. Not with this
warning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not <i>land</i>!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not to-night. Get your rifles, Kenton
and MacAfee. Lincoln, you and Lewis at
the sweeps. Lew needs to get warm.
Don’t shoot unless we’re attacked in canoes.
We may have passed the danger Jimmy
speaks of, or we may be floating into it. I
must go and look after poor Cutler. Moses,
mind your oar!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Kenton and MacAfee confronted the
captain as he started to go to the cabin.
“We’re goin’ back for Jimmy,” they said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>threateningly. “He saved Lewis, here.
He’s saved the ark. Do you think we’ll
slink off into safety and leave him to the
savages?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The captain wheeled on them. “Did
Jimmy ask for help?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, but——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then mind his warning. He’s playing
his game. He could have come aboard
when he was in the canoe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dressed as an Indian?” asked Kenton,
contemptuously. “How long would we
have let him live?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“While he told us his name,” returned
the captain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know better,” said MacAfee,
hotly. “He daren’t risk it. You’re a
coward, Marion Royce, that’s what.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And not avenge Cutler?” said Kenton.
“Give us a boat. Give us the canoe if you
won’t give us a boat, and we’ll go back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion Royce stood before them fearlessly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>These were the men he had feared.
Tried rivermen, both; utterly fearless,
utterly insubordinate. A man named
Merrick, and a younger one named Corson,
both from Marietta, came forward and
ranged themselves alongside Kenton and
MacAfee. “We’re goin’ with ’em,” they
said, sullenly. “We don’t turn our backs
on no friend.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion faced them. As they stood on
the deck they were a fair mark in the
moonlight for any chance robber who might
pot them from the mouth of one of the
caves. Lewis and Lincoln were at the
sweeps. Moses, at the oar, was watching
with his heart in his throat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You want to help Jimmy?” asked
Marion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’re goin’ to.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You want to avenge Cutler?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aye; we’re goin’ to do that, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then wait till daylight, and I’ll go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>back with you, with horses. Now, let me
see to Cutler.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He passed them without waiting for
their objections. As he stepped into the
cabin he met Charlie Hoyt. “Take
your gun, and watch those Marietta fellows,”
he said. “If one of them attempts
to steal a boat, or leave the ark in any way,
cover him, but don’t shoot. He’ll come
down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He went to Cutler’s bunk, and found
him raised almost to a sitting posture, gasping
for breath. Examining his wound, he
found him shot through the heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ain’t sufferin’ a mite,” panted Cutler,
cheerily. “Just make me a dressing of
slippery elm and stramonium leaves, with a
leetle warm water, son. That’s what Jane
allus doctored gunshot wounds with. A
grand dressing it made.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He began to cough, and Marion raised
him in his arm. A bright stream of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>arterial blood gushed from between his
lips. Hastily laying him flat, Marion tried
to stop the hemorrhage with the means at
his command, but it was a hopeless effort.
The old pioneer, who had recovered from
wounds and fevers in the wilderness, had
succumbed to a stray bullet where he stood
in comparative safety in the midst of his
friends.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a pioneer’s death, merciful
in comparison with Indian capture, but
Marion clenched his hands as he looked
down at him. Kenton and MacAfee would
not have thought him wanting in loyalty.
No one who had heard him coolly give the
unwelcome order to man the sweeps and
postpone vengeance knew what it had cost
him to give it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The shot that killed Cutler had come
from some lurking Indian or white renegade;
or, as Cutler himself had pointed out,
might have been fired for the purpose of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>provoking the ark’s crew to land; a war
party might have been lying in ambush.
Jimmy’s warning pointed to that. Even if
the miscreant had been alone and remained
hidden in the recesses of the cave, it would
have been impossible to capture him without
losing one or more men. The current,
also, was unusually rapid and the
shore rocky and dangerous. It had been
impossible to explain all this to the
mutinous, excited men, but none of these
facts were ignored by the quick-witted
young captain, who held all their lives in
trust for those at home, as well as the
responsibility for their goods, and the ark,
and now, as he looked down at John
Cutler, he seemed to be saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I <i>could</i> avenge you—if I only
could!”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was only a moment that he stood so.
Then a shot rang overhead, quickly followed
by a volley. Feet ran along the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>deck, and shouted orders were repeated
from bow to stern. Marion ran out, looking
to the priming of his gun as he caught
it up from a rack.</p>

<p class='c011'>Howls and shouts were mingling in a
pandemonium as he gained the deck. He
stumbled over Moses, who was rolling
over and over in the clutches of one of the
assailants.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take this one, Marion,” said Lincoln,
speaking almost hurriedly; “he’s got my
knife. I’ll be back for him when I
take in my sweep. Don’t you let him
get away without getting back my knife.
Molly Royce gave it to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you give her a penny for it?”
asked Charlie Hoyt, as he staggered by,
half carrying a struggling form that he
lifted bodily when he reached the rail, and
threw into the river.</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion stooped to extricate Moses from
his difficulties, and received a blow from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Moses’ heavy boot heel that sent him reeling.
Lewis caught him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion staggered to his feet. “Cut
loose their boat,” he said, stumbling towards
the stern where the attackers’ boat
rode in tow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hold on—nothing in that but dead,”
said Lewis. “We shot into ’em, just as
they came out of a cave after us. They
shot, but we dropped on the deck after we
fired and they didn’t hit us. Mose is
through with his Indian.—No! He’s under
again!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take my musket and beat him off!”
shouted Kenton, who lay helpless in the
scuppers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Don’t shoot!</i>” cried the Indian, suddenly
springing up and lifting his hand,
“<i>I’m a white man!</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s Jimmy,” drawled Lincoln, coming
back from his careful attention to the starboard
sweep. “Why don’t you say who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>you are, you blockhead, letting Lewis get a
bead on you before you introduce yourself?
Have you got my knife, Marion?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy, for it was he, stood panting
over the prostrate Mose. “I wanted to get
through lickin’ him,” he explained. “I was
afraid if I said who I was he’d leave me for
one of the real robbers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And so I would have,” said Mose,
sitting up and mopping a bleeding nose
with his sleeve. “I don’t think you’ve any
right to settle private quarrels when there’s
something that wants doing like this.” He
was incensed that he had expended his
valor on a friend and neighbor, when the
others had repelled real enemies. He got
to his feet and felt of himself in high discontent.
“You’ve broken one of my ribs,
Jim Claiborne, and you’ll have to pay for
it,” he said, fumbling with both hands to
minister to his bleeding nose and his internal
injuries at one and the same time.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>It was such an absurd finish to a very
grave danger, that those who witnessed it
leaned against the cabin and the rail, laughing
until they held their sides. Even Kenton
was laughing, although a torn ligament
twisted his face with pain the next minute.</p>

<p class='c011'>The deck showed littered with scraps
of clothing and two dead bodies, in the
moonlight. The members of the crew
who were unhurt fell to straightening up,
and Jimmy, in his feathered head-dress and
uncouth paint, took command of the
obsequies of his recent companions. The
two on deck he helped to drop overboard,
where the river received them as it had
often received their victims.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s one in the boat you want to
keep,” he said to Marion. “Whoever shot
him gets a reward at Natchez from the
government. He’s got a price on his
head. I’ll show you which he is in the
morning—one of Mason’s gang.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Mason, the leader of a band of outlaws
who had infested the river for years, had
been killed and his head brought into the
fort for ransom the year previous.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The chap we’ve got back there,”
Jimmy explained, condescendingly to
Moses, “is Big Harp.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At the name, familiar to all rivermen,
the ark’s crew gazed upon Jimmy with
something akin to reverence. He accepted
the tribute for a full minute, growing tall
in the pride of it. Then, as if he thought
of something that touched him more closely
than pride, his uncouth, painted face
changed. He went over to Marion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I couldn’t get to you any other way,”
he explained. “If I’d come aboard when
that fellow dragged Lewis into the river, I
ran a good chance of getting killed even
before I could warn you. And if I hadn’t
joined in the attack, they’d have killed me.
I had to lead the party. You see, don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>you, Marion? There wasn’t no other
way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked anxiously into Marion’s face.
“You can trust me,” he added. “I’ve
seen all I want of——of revenge, and outlawry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you?” asked Moses, elbowing
forward.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh,” said Jimmy, contemptuously—<i>“you!</i>
Yes, I’m satisfied with you, too.
All I want is to stay along on the ark—along
with the horses and the chickens,
after I’ve licked Louis Gist. I don’t see
him anywhere. I thought he was goin’
along with you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He went overboard, up the river,”
explained Lewis Hoyt.</p>

<p class='c011'>The thought of Louis Gist made them
silent a moment, and Marion remembered
poor Cutler, the only other victim of their
perilous voyage so far.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh,” said Jimmy; “well, I guess I’m
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>not going to hold that grudge any longer.
Marion, will you take me along?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion had stood silent, thinking of
Uncle Amasa hiding his breaking heart
under a brave front as the ark sailed away.
He wanted to say, “Oh, Jimmy, why did
you!” but instead of that he held out his
hand, and the tall young Indian grasped it
and shook it up and down in a way inherited
from an Anglo-Saxon ancestry.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Will</i> we?” said Marion; “well, you
just try us! Some of these fellows wanted
to mutiny to go back for you, on account
of your letter—didn’t you, Kenton?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think you might look at my leg,”
grumbled Kenton, shamefacedly.</p>

The sun had risen before the
crew of the ark finished
their grim clearing of the
decks and the skiff in which
the outlaws had rowed out
to attack the ark. There
was no way of telling who
had fired the shot which
killed the notorious outlaw, on whose head
a price of a thousand dollars had been fixed.
Marion was in favor of burying him in the
river with his two companions of the skiff,
but Jimmy had the matter very much at
heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just let me have his head,” pleaded
that young savage. “If I can take his head
to the fort I won’t ask them for the reward—honest,
I won’t. But this Big Harp was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>just about the worst of the whole lot, and
mebby if the others learn that he’s paid for
his crimes they won’t be so venturesome.
He was worse than the Indians.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He spoke with so much emotion that
Marion felt the force of his argument. If
it became definitely proven that Big Harp
had been delivered up to justice at the army
post, it would make a great difference in
the safety of the pioneers and rivermen.
They—Big Harp and Little Harp, and John
Mason—had been the leaders of a band of
robbers, thirty or more in number, who for
ten years were the terror of Ohio boatmen;
they attacked “arks” and “keels” alike,
and on several occasions had murdered the entire
crew of the captured craft. Their actual
headquarters had been Diamond Island, just
below Henderson; but the caverns higher up
the river made convenient lurking places,
from which they could sally forth, or into
which they could retreat secure from pursuit.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Jimmy watched the captain anxiously.
In the bright light of sunrise, Jimmy’s
paint and feathers failed grotesquely to conceal
the white man. His head had been
shorn, all but the scalp and forelock, which
were put up in a piece of tin, with a bunch
of turkey feathers, while the feathers of
at least two turkeys hung to the hair of his
scalp.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’re a sight,” said Moses, as he
gazed on these uncouth adornments, while
Marion was making up his mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d ’a been more of a sight if this Big
Harp had had his way with me,” answered
Jimmy, whose eyes never left the young
captain’s face. “<i>He</i> wanted to cut off my
ears and eyelids because I wouldn’t tell him
exactly when the ark would sail from Fish
Creek. Only for Logan—the one I went
away with from my cabin—he would have
done it, too. Logan was a pretty good
friend to me because I helped him to get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>away when he had a broken leg. He
would have been caught and handed over
to the authorities more than once if I
hadn’t been along. He was pretty helpless.
After he was killed by the Shawnees
I lost my job, though, and as the robbers
didn’t have any agricultural employment
for me (they said that that was all I was fit
for, because I wouldn’t turn pirate), they took
my gun away from me and launched me in
a canoe that happened to be hauled up in
a creek where we camped. There was a
dead Shawnee lying by it; and, before they
let me go, Big Harp and that one-eyed fellow
that you dumped out of the skiff just
now, thought it would be fun to decorate
me with his head-dress, so that I shouldn’t
miss the clothes they took from me. Those
outlaws actually lost a good hour fixing me
up, and then put me into the canoe and
shoved me off and told me I could go on
and join my father at the Chickasaw Bluffs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>and maybe he’d recognize me by the
resemblance between us. They wouldn’t
give me even a day’s rations. Big Harp
said the ark would be along and that you’d
take me in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy told these things stolidly, without
laying any particular stress on them
until he came to the way in which Big
Harp and his gang had amused themselves
by making him into a feathered object of
derision before launching him on the river
without food and with no more covering
than the dead savage had worn. His voice
trembled with rage when he told of that,
and Moses, who was always the first to feel
any strong emotion in those around him,
and to respond to it, shut his fists passionately.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish we could kill them over
again,” Mose ejaculated. “We killed ’em
too easy. They had ought to have hung.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy looked at him. It was the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>moment he had taken his somber eyes off
of Marion since he had asked for the outlaw’s
head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Mose,” he said, “even hanging
would have been too good for ’em.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How did they get hold of you again?”
asked Marion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I drifted for two days and nights before
I could get ashore,” said Jimmy, taking up
his story where he had left off. “They
weren’t able to find the paddle that the
dead Indian had had, or else they had
hidden it themselves, so I had nothing to
control the canoe with, and I couldn’t get
to shore.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why didn’t you drop overboard and
swim for it?” asked Lewis.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In that ice water, with that current
and no knowing how long it would take
me? You couldn’t swim in the river, even
to-day, for fifteen minutes, without doubling
up with a cramp and going down! What’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>the use of asking me a fool question like
that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” added Moses, “what do you
want to go interrupting him for?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’re interrupting just as much yourself,”
retorted Lewis.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy smiled at them, and then went
on addressing Marion. “You get mighty
hungry when you’ve been floating down
the river two or three days. Finally, I paddled
with my hands into a creek into
which the water had backed up considerably.
It was along about sundown, I reckon.
There were some men working on board an
ark—not as big as this, and not very much
more than just decked over. They were
hammering so hard, trying to get all they
could done before night, most likely, that
they didn’t hear me shout to them, but
went right on working while I got my
canoe beached and started to ’em. I had to
pick my way through the blackberry bushes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>and grapevines that grew thick along the
creek, and I was so sick from hunger that
I expect I sort of crept towards ’em, wondering
if I’d have strength to get to
them before they stopped work and went
home, and if I’d have strength left to shout
when they stopped hammering. I was so
glad to see honest men that that made me
sort of sick, too. I’d ’a’ been pearter if it
had been Indians or outlaws. But, just the
thought that I was in sight of friends made
me tremble so I couldn’t scarcely stand up.
I never remembered my head-dress. When
I was in the canoe I kept it on because I
thought if I passed any Indians they
wouldn’t notice me so much, and when I
got into the creek and saw the white men
I forgot everything except to try to get to
them as quick as I knew how.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did they <i>fire</i> at you?” exclaimed
Moses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fire? They fired the minute they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>clapped eyes on my head-dress over the
bushes. They didn’t wait to see the color
of the rest of me. The minute they fired
I understood, but it was too late. Some
Indians who were passing by ran in on
them before they’d time to load again, and
scalped the whole outfit, and took me captive.
They were pleased to death with my
decorations—I don’t know why; and they
made a sort of mascot of me, except that I
had to carry the loads, when we traveled,
and they showed me by signs that I’d have
to do squaw’s work when we got to camp.
They fed me like themselves, but I was too
faint to eat their sort of cooking; and you
would be, too, if you had seen the way
they cooked. Then I showed them I
wanted to cook for myself, and they let me
do it to get back my strength. I reckon it
must have been a week. I didn’t keep
track of time, and we didn’t go near
any settlements. One night we camped in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>the mouth of a cave near the river. It was
raining, and it had been raining all day. I
expect I was feverish and my head was
flighty, for I got an idea into it that I’d
find the other mouth of the cave, which
very likely overlooked the river, and sit in
it and wait for you to come by in the ark.
It was a little past the first quarter, and I
thought it had been the last quarter of the
moon when I left my cabin with Logan.
You see I was mixed, but I thought I had
it all clearly reasoned out. So I wandered
off into the cave.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did the Indians chase you?” asked
Moses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” said Jimmy, “I don’t reckon
they did. They had too much sense, probably,
after they’d found how far in I’d
gone. They hadn’t any idea of getting
lost themselves. That cave was a hundred
caves, all partitioned off and running in and
out of each other. I expect I pretty near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>died in them. All I remember is creeping
and crawling along on my hands and
knees most of the time, half the time in
the water and half the time out, and then I
went sort of crazy and beat against the
rocks and screamed until the whole cavern
mocked and mocked me. The next thing
I knew I was lying on blankets in a cave
that was fitted up as a hiding-place, and
I learned that my rescuers were part of Big
Harp’s gang. When Big Harp and the
rest came, they were so amused they
couldn’t do enough for me. They said
they had come down to meet you folks,
and that I should lead the party.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How did you come to have the letter
to write the warning on?” asked Moses,
whose imagination had supplied the rest of
the story, and run ahead of the narrator.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Big Horn wasn’t a good reader,” said
Jimmy, “and I had been given the letter,
to make out what he couldn’t make out for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>himself. Big Horn thought it said something
about the Governor sending some
money by the brig that was to leave Marietta
with the ‘fresh,’ and he thought it
might be more worth while to make sure
of the brig than to capture you fellows.
But when he learned that the word that he
thought was ‘money’ was ‘<i>militia</i>,’ he lost
interest in the letter, and they decided not
to wait very long for you folks. If you
hadn’t come in a day or two, they would
have gone back further into the caves until
the brig was safely past.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose,” said Lincoln, “that the
ark we passed, where the men were scalped,
was the place where you were captured.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy looked absently at Lincoln. “I
guess that’s about all,” he said to Marion.
“Big Harp warned me, when we attacked
you, that if I turned on any of the gang he
and the rest of his crowd would avenge
themselves on any of you they captured, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>they got the best of the fight. That’s why
I didn’t kill any of them when the fight
began.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s why you pitched into <i>me</i>?”
asked Moses, in a sympathetic voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Jimmy. “I didn’t want
to seem to be idling.” He fixed Marion
with his steady, dogged eyes. “Now, may
I have Big Harp’s head to take to the commandant
at Natchez?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion looked from one to another of
the arksmen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Yes!</i>” they shouted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Marion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cutler’s body was buried that evening
on a wooded eminence of Cumberland
Island, overlooking the Ohio and opposite
the mouth of the Cumberland River.
Many such solitary graves double-line the
banks of these great water-ways—the
unmarked resting places of victims of savage
hate, or outlaw violence and robbery.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Later, in the night, the ark passed Diamond
Island, so long the home of the river pirates.
It loomed beside them, safe, silent, wooded,
wrapped in peace.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next morning they were floating
across the broad mouth of the Tennessee
River, nearly half as wide as the Ohio itself,
past the site of the pretty city of Paducah.
At two that afternoon Cairo was sighted,
with the broad channel of the Mississippi
in plain view over the forest to the northwest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Little enough like the populous and commercially
important Cairo of to-day, was the
Cairo of a century ago! Not a house was
then to be discerned on the dreary mud-flats.
The “town” consisted—this is not a joke—of
a single long flatboat, moored by two
infirm old cables to stumps ashore! Aboard
this capacious “broadhorn,” however, there
was a “tavern,” a “saloon,” a smithy and a
general store; and, altogether, the queer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>craft harbored seventy or eighty persons,
men and women. As was not unusual in
those days, the saloon did the larger
share of the business, and of the character
of these early inhabitants of Cairo
the arksmen were soon able to form an
opinion.</p>

<p class='c011'>For, contrary to their captain’s wishes,
Merrick, Charlie Hoyt, Simon Corson,
Kenton and MacAfee insisted on paying
the floating “town” a visit, to indulge in a
social glass and hear the news of the two
rivers. The ark was, therefore, tied up
for the night a few hundred yards above
the “city,” which six of the older men
visited in the skiff.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the evening, however, an altercation
occurred between the visitors and a
crew of rough fellows at the saloon; and
in the unseemly “mix-up” which followed,
Simon Corson had his right eye badly injured—in
a most unfair fight, it was claimed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>He came back to the ark, in that pitiful
condition, a little past midnight. MacAfee,
also, had been savagely kicked and beaten.</p>

<p class='c011'>So incensed were Corson’s companions
that it was with difficulty that Marion prevented
them from turning on the town
with their rifles, at dead of night. He did
not forget the indignity, however, and
“Cairo” had yet to hear from him on
this score.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for Corson, he was in his bunk for
two weeks, and suffered a permanent disfigurement.
It proved a costly social glass
for him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Casting off very early the next morning,
the arksmen dropped down past Cairo,
being jeered from the saloon door as they
did so, and soon reached the confluence of
the two mighty rivers.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a scene of quiet, yet imposing,
grandeur. The strong, muddy current of
the Ohio, fully a mile in width at flood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>pushed forcefully out in opposition, and for
a time seemed to have the mastery; but
soon the more voluminous, stronger, and
even muddier current of the great Father of
Waters prevailed, and with a thousand
boiling eddies and vast upheavals of the
contending streams, the Ohio was forced to
yield and was borne away captive.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a matter of no little surprise to
Lewis and Moses—this being their first
voyage—to find the Mississippi below the
confluence with the Ohio no wider. But
the depth was manifestly much greater and
the current more rapid. Before noon that
day the ark was passing Iron Banks, a line
of dark-red bluffs along the left shore.</p>

<div id='i185'  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i185.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='small'>A “KEEL” FROM ST. LOUIS CAME ALONGSIDE</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The breaking of a sweep, however,
compelled the men to tie up for two or
three hours, and while they were here a
“keel” of forty tons, from St. Louis, came
alongside and spoke them, in the hope of
buying eggs and poultry.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Thus far they had seen but few boats
on the Ohio, and had actually spoken but
two, both from up the Wabash—the
one a broadhorn, the other a keel
from Vincennes. Yet now, as a chance
result of the erratic navigation of those
days, the Mississippi seemed suddenly
to swarm with ascending and descending
flats, keels and skiffs. Merry salutes from
the horns and bugles of the boatmen were
heard every few minutes.</p>

<p class='c011'>A ship, too, was lying-by in the bay
below Iron Banks; and a “smithy”
also passed while the captain of the keel
was hailing them—a cheery ding-dong from
the blacksmiths’ anvils resounding from the
steep bank.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon after the keel had left them two
large arks from Kaskaskia veered in, to pass
the time of day and ask whether any late
news had been heard from down the river.
For the attitude of the Spaniards toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Americans at New Orleans was now the
absorbing topic of interest. Whether they
could make a market or not meant much
to these arksmen, whose all was often at
stake on the chances of a voyage.</p>

<p class='c011'>A skiff and two “covered sleds” from
Cincinnati, loaded with horses, also came
in sight up-stream, and seeing the three
arks lying-by in company, they also veered
in and joined the little flotilla at the foot of
Iron Banks.</p>

<p class='c011'>No such warm weather had as yet been
experienced, not even at Big Bone Creek.</p>

<p class='c011'>Herons and other aquatic birds were
flapping lazily up and down the shores; the
sunshine was so hot and the air so stagnant
that the horses and other live stock beneath
the low roofs of the arks were manifestly
distressed.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was much talk of a hostile
Indian band at Island No. 10; and the
captains of the two arks from Kaskaskia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>proposed an arrangement very common in
those days, namely, that they should make
the three broadhorns and the two covered
sleds fast to each other by spars and hawsers,
and so float down in company, for
mutual aid and protection in case of attack,
either by the savages or riotous white boatmen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Self-reliance and a disposition to manage
his own boat without depending on others,
were leading traits of Marion Royce’s
character; but, since the other captains
asked it and his own crew liked the idea,
he consented; and the three larger craft
were made fast abreast, with the two Cincinnati
flats and the skiff astern, and in this
order they poled off from Iron Banks.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was now about four o’clock in the
afternoon, the sun still very hot and the air
close and sultry. Clouds were rising in the
northwest, however, with promise of a
breeze or a shower; and, being desirous of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>catching the first cool breath that came,
Moses Ayer, Lewis Hoyt and Wistar Royce
climbed on the roof of their ark. Here
they could overlook the entire flotilla, as
well as the shores of the river.</p>

<p class='c011'>The peculiar aspect of the sky at once
attracted their attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s a mighty queer-looking cloud!”
Lewis exclaimed. “Looks like smoke, and
see how the edges of it are rolling in together!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s a thunder-squall coming,” said
Wistar. “It’s coming fast, too!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Below there, Mack,” he shouted to
his brother, who was forward under the
roof. “Squall coming!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The young captain climbed to the roof
to see for himself, for the roofs of the two
large Kaskaskia boats on each side of them
obstructed the view from the deck of the
ark. He had hardly done so, however,
when they saw the trees on the other shore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>of the river sway, bend, and twist violently.
Branches, twigs and leaves were whirled
upward, and immediately the intervening
water of the river was wildly agitated,
appearing to rise in the air in vast white
sheets.</p>

<p class='c011'>No opportunity was afforded for precautions
of any sort. They barely had time to
swing down from the roof when, with a
wild howl, the squall—a true tornado—was
upon them!</p>

<p class='c011'>Everything loose on the roof—the large
poultry-cages, spare sweeps, oars, setting-poles,
and a part of the mammoth bones—were
whirled upward and away; and, not
only from their ark, but from all the others,
everything loose went flying to leeward.
The roof of the ark to windward of them
was torn off, and, with a terrific crash, went
hurtling over their heads.</p>

<p class='c011'>The shouts of the men blended with
the squalling of poultry and the hideous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>squeals of terrified or injured horses. Immediately,
too, the heavy craft felt the
impulse of the tornado, and went drifting
rapidly before it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whether they would have been safer
apart than together is not easy to say. The
two flatboats astern prevented the arks from
using their sweeps; and, seeing that all six
of the boats were being blown rapidly
toward the bank, Marion Royce shouted
to the captains of the two Kaskaskia arks
to cut the hawsers and try to get clear of
each other, so as to use their sweeps.</p>

<p class='c011'>If they heard, which is doubtful,
nothing was done; in fact, the craft to
windward was in great distress from waves
that were breaking aboard her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Royce then seized an ax and
cut the cables himself. His instinct was to
get free. As he did so one of the spars
caught, and slipping inboard, crashed
through the gun-room, seriously injuring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>MacAfee, who had run in there for shelter.
But the pressure of the wind still held the
boats together; they drove on before the
gale, and within five minutes all went
ashore where a gravel bank rose steep out
of deep water.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fortunately for the ark, it had the
middle berth; for, owing to the momentum
and weight of the mass of boats, the
Kaskaskia ark next the bank gave beam, and
was so crushed that it immediately filled and
sank, the crew with difficulty escaping
across to the other boats.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the flats astern—the one inshore—also
sank. Six of the horses aboard it,
whose halters it was impossible to cut, were
drawn down; the other fourteen of the
poor animals succeeded in keeping their
heads above water. The boatmen were
powerless to do anything for them; indeed,
the attention of all was given to rescuing
the crews of the two wrecked boats.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Rain was now falling in such sheets
that it was impossible to see objects twenty
yards away. What became of the six-ton
skiff that had joined them no one knew.
So dire was the confusion and uproar of the
disaster that none of the survivors was able
to give any information concerning it—whether
it was swamped, with all on board,
or had got free and gone out of sight below
the foot of the bluff. It was manned by
four pioneers, one of them a clergyman
named Willis, from the new settlement at
Fort Jefferson, a little below the mouth of
the Ohio.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two men had been drowned or crushed
on board the wrecked Kaskaskia ark; the
other one had also lost a man, probably
knocked overboard and drowned when the
roof was blown off. A man was also
reported missing from the Cincinnati flatboat.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even after the tornado had passed and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>the waves subsided, the three craft which
had escaped were in bad plight, having lost
nearly all their sweeps, poles and other
gear. Evening was at hand, and being
unable to get away, they lay there against
the bank all night.</p>

<p class='c011'>By working hard with lines and a
pulley-block, eight of the horses in the
water were hauled out. The other flat
from Cincinnati, being a small craft, could
take but three of them aboard, however,
and what to do with the poor animals became
a serious question with their almost
equally luckless owners. Our arksmen
finally made shift to find room for them
alongside their own horses. Captain Royce
consented to take them on shares, and pay
one-half what he could sell them for in
New Orleans, when he came back up the
river in the fall.</p>

<p class='c011'>A large brindled wolf-dog, called
“Tige,” from one of the wrecked boats,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>also came aboard and savagely refused to
go ashore with his former friends and
master.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a dreary night for all concerned;
doubly so for the crews of the foundered
boats, who had now no alternative before
them save to trudge disconsolately back
along the river bank for hundreds of miles,
and deem themselves fortunate if they
reached home without losing their scalps.</p>

<p class='c011'>Working by lantern-light, our own
arksmen hewed out new steering sweeps
from planks ripped from the bulwarks, and
succeeded in getting off at daylight. They
had had enough of river partnerships.
Captain Royce gave such friendly aid as he
was able to the other boats, but firmly
declined to establish any closer relations
with them. Altogether this first day on
the Mississippi had been an exciting one,
but even greater perils were at hand.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
Never day dawned
fairer than that following
the tornado. Our
arksmen, thankful to
have escaped the fate
of their fellow-voyagers,
put off early, and at noon were passing
Island No. 10.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here, by Marion Royce’s orders, the
men took their rifles and lay concealed
below the rail of the ark, Merrick and
Charlie Hoyt alone standing exposed at the
sweeps. After this fashion they passed
down the narrow reach on the left, keeping
a sharp eye to both shores.</p>

<p class='c011'>No enemies were sighted, however, and
at four in the afternoon the infant town of
New Madrid came into view, on its pretty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>plain along the right bank, which as yet
the river had not gnawed away. The
place was one of the feeble efforts of the
Spaniards to establish colonies in the Mississippi
Valley.</p>

<p class='c011'>For, although at the date of our story,
the Spanish were in possession of New
Orleans and the lower course of the river,
this control was nominal and temporary, the
outcome of treaty between France and
Spain, rather than real or permanent. The
two nations which, for the century prior to
1803, had so long and so bitterly contended
for the mastery of this peerless region,
were France and England; and, for a period
of time as great as that which has elapsed
since the War of the Revolution, the whole
Mississippi Valley was virtually French
territory. The Louisiana Purchase marked
the close of an era, the end of a century of
French sovereignty; this event transferred
the control of by far the most important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>portion of what is now the United States,
from the French to the Anglo-American
people.</p>

<p class='c011'>At New Madrid not less than a hundred
river craft of every variety were tied up,
either for purposes of trade or repair;
“keels” and barges from Pittsburgh, the
full-rigged brig from Marietta, four arks
from Vincennes, flatboats from far up the
Wabash, with a great number of skiffs,
and pirogues from the various military
posts. So diverse and heterogeneous a
gathering of boatmen could hardly meet
and mingle without friction; and, in strict
point of fact, the first thing our arksmen
saw, on veering to the bank, was a “rough-and-tumble”
between the Marietta brig’s
crew and some boatmen from up the
Wabash.</p>

<p class='c011'>The latter had a flatboat loaded with
sugar, and live turkeys, not less than three
hundred of which fine birds were confined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>in huge wooden cages on the roof of their
craft. The brig’s crew, victorious in the
scuffle, levied heavily on the flatboatmen’s
turkeys.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last, the little garrison at the post
attempted to restore order, but with indifferent
success; the brig’s crew threatened to
sack the town if molested, and appeared
able to make good the menace. Such was
New Madrid in 1803.</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion Royce’s only object in landing
here was to procure two strong sweeps for
the ark. Having accomplished this in the
course of an hour or two, he resumed his
voyage and continued for two hours longer
before tying up in the eddy at the foot of
an island for the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here, both the arksmen and their live
stock were badly tortured by large, ravenous
mosquitoes. Moreover, they sorely missed
their poultry, this and the milk from their two
cows being important items of the food supply.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>They were also rendered apprehensive
from a bold visit by a canoe containing
four Indians, supposed to be Choctaws, that
came alongside the ark and held up a
bearskin as if to sell it. But Marion was of
the opinion that their real motive was to
learn if an attack on them would be likely
to prove successful. Three men watched,
by turns, all night.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they were putting off at daybreak,
three lumber-laden arks from Pittsburgh
appeared and made a landing near them for
repairs, one of them having run on a snag
during the night. That day they made
about sixty miles, passing Island No. 31 at
four in the afternoon; and then crossing
over to avoid Flour Island, tied up for the
night at the foot of a high bluff of yellow
clay, crowned by forest.</p>

<p class='c011'>A huge tree which had fallen down the
bank afforded opportunity to make fast,
although the current was here very swift
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>and strong, making in against the bank so
forcefully that the ark was pressed hard
against the great branches of the tree-top,
which lay partly in the water.</p>

<p class='c011'>Flour Island, so called from a disaster
to flour-laden boats which had recently
occurred there, lay over opposite them;
and there appeared to be an Indian camp
near the lower end of it, judging from the
fires, and an uproar of savage outcries that
was borne to their ears. No such swift,
dangerous currents had been encountered
anywhere since the voyage began as these
which set in through the “races” between
the islands and bluffs. The ark, being deep-laden,
they were not a little apprehensive
for her safety.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just as they were making fast, too,
another lumber-laden barge came drifting
past, close into shore, and struck them with
such force as to stave in the bulwarks aft and
break two stanchions that supported the roof.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>As the two boats hung in contact for a
moment, there was a singular accession to
the crew of the ark. A large pet bear,
terrified, perhaps, by the crash, and seeing,
as he thought, a way of escaping ashore,
broke his chain and leaped across from the
lumber barge to the roof of the ark just as
the two boats swung clear of each other.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a muttered malediction from her
captain, who seemed in a bad temper, the
lumber boat drifted away on the swift current.
The bear, meanwhile, was making
for the shore, but when he attempted to
clamber down the other side of the roof,
his chain caught in a crack between the
planks and brought him up short at the
bulwarks of the main deck below.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, the pet of the lumbermen was
transferred from one craft to the other, and
all in a space of less than five seconds of
time!</p>

<p class='c011'>In the gathering dusk the arksmen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>stood staring after the barge which had
given them so rude a salute. Captain Royce
then hailed them:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hallo, the barge!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hallo, the ark!” was the gruff
response from the receding craft.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ve left something!” Marion
shouted, laughing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And good riddance!” was the uncivil
response.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile the wolf-dog, Tige, who
considered himself guardian of the ark,
set upon the bear, tooth and nail, but
came off badly from the encounter. The
crew gathered round, and after looking the
newcomer over by lantern-light, secured
him more comfortably and fed him. He
was a fine black bear, about a year and a
half old.</p>

<p class='c011'>After supper, and as the evening passed,
Marion Royce, according to his custom
when repairs were needed, set to work to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>replace the broken stanchion posts, and
called Moses Ayer to hold the lantern for
him. Lewis Hoyt was on the roof out forward,
doing lookout duty and watching the
fires on Flour Island; but the rest of the
crew had turned in.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently Lewis came back aft. “I
think there’s a buffalo up the bluff,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moses laughed. Captain Royce, busy
with his adz, paid little attention; buffalo
were still to be found on the prairies along
the river.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lewis stood near them for a few
moments, then went forward again. The
ark chafed against the tree branches with
harsh, creaking sounds; frogs were croaking,
and from the island, at intervals, came
a singular noise, as of some large horn
blown with great effort. This was followed
by the reports of guns and loud yells;
but whether the savages over there were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>celebrating some festival, or fighting, was
not clear.</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Royce went on with his work.
Before long, however, Lewis joined them
again. “There’s something up the bluff,”
he insisted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How d’ye know?” said Moses. “You
can’t see it, can you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I can hear it,” replied Lewis,
nervously. “A stone or something rolled
down just now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stones and earth often roll down when
the water is high,” remarked Captain
Royce.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I tell you there’s something up
there!” repeated Lewis.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Lew’s scared,” said Moses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No more scared than you!” retorted
Lewis. “If it’s a buffalo, I’m going to
shoot it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t you go to firing, Lewis,” Marion
said. “Let the buffalo go. And you had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>better get up on the roof again,” he continued.
“I want you to keep a sharp eye
up-stream for boats or floating trees. Don’t
come down here again till I send a man to
take your place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus admonished, Lewis climbed on the
roof once more and remained there for an
hour or so, when Moses, his task of holding
the lantern being over, went up to see if
anything new had happened.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of late the two boys had wrangled
somewhat; ever since Moses had shot the
“gobbler” he affected a certain superiority
over Lewis, although he was not as old as
the latter by a year. Lewis resented this.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know what you came up here for,”
Lewis said, shortly. “You think you will
have that bear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, what if I do?” exclaimed
Moses. “You claimed Tige.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tige is only a dog,” replied Lewis.
“He will not fetch anything, but we can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>swap that bear for a silver-mounted rifle at
New Orleans.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I shall have it!” insisted Moses.
“You were all so fast to claim Tige. Now,
I claim the bear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You never want to play fair in anything!”
exclaimed Lewis.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you are always whining when anybody
gets even with you!” Moses retorted.</p>

<p class='c011'>What further plain truths the boys
might have told each other is not certain;
but, at this juncture, both were startled by a
pebble that came bouncing down the bluff
and hopped clear across to the roof of the
ark, thence off into the river.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, what do you think did that?”
whispered Lewis, gripping his rifle and
peering sharply into the night mists that
enveloped both river and bluffs.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, ’twas just a little slide of loose
earth that came down, and the stone happened
to hop across here,” said Moses.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“But that’s just the way it did twice
before,” whispered Lewis. “I tell you,
Mose, there’s something up there. I believe
I can see something, too, up there
against the sky, ’mongst the tree trunks,”
he added. “I’ve a good notion to fire at it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mack told you not to,” said Moses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then, you go get Tige and put
him up here, and get the lantern,” rejoined
Lewis, after they had listened a while.
“Let’s tie the lantern to the end of one of
these long, new setting-poles, and hoist it
up high. Maybe we can see then what’s
up there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This idea pleased Moses. He swung
down from the roof, put Tige up, and getting
the lantern, proceeded to light the
candle, after the tedious method of those
days. Passing his arm through the big
wooden ring, he was about to climb up to
the roof when a deep rumble was heard,
like low, heavy thunder.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>The ark started violently, then seemed
to receive a tremendous impulse, as if
pushed off by a giant hand from the bank.
It careened far over. Every timber cracked.
The live stock lurched and leaped back,
tugging at their halters. Then the heavy
craft appeared to rise, like a ship on a great
wave at sea. Momentarily, too, a sharp
crash was heard, accompanied by a shock
as from a sudden blow. The whole forward
end of the roof broke down, and
distressed squeals rose from the horses.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moses Ayer, who was on the rail in the
act of climbing up, was pitched headlong
into the river. As he rose he felt the side
of the ark come hard against him, and a
loose plank from the roof slid down close
beside his head. He caught hold of it and
held on, floating with the current.</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Royce and Shadwell Lincoln,
who were still awake in the gun-room,
sprang forth at the first rumble, but were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>thrown down by the violent lurch that followed
it. Shouts of terror were heard from
those who had been asleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>No one knew what had happened; but,
hearing the crash forward, Captain Royce
made his way there as fast as he could, and
tried to learn the extent of the damage.
The ark was rocking heavily, and immediately
her young captain perceived that
they had broken adrift and were floating
down-stream. Shouting to Hoyt and Lincoln,
he bade them man the after-sweep
with all speed and try to keep clear of the
bank; for the craft was going broadside to
the current.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not till the men tried to work
the sweep that they discovered a long tree
trunk lying afoul of them forward—across
the broken roof. Apparently, it had fallen
on them from up the bluff; yet they did
not appear to be leaking.</p>

<p class='c011'>Distressed cries of “Hallo, the ark!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>were now heard astern; and the captain at
once began calling the crew by name, to
see if any one were missing. All answered
except Moses and Lewis. It was then
remembered that Lewis had been on lookout
duty upon the roof.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s Mose back there in the water!”
Wistar Royce exclaimed.  “I know by
the voice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Get out the skiff!” exclaimed the
captain, and all haste was made to do so;
for, by Captain Royce’s orders, the skiff was
now hauled aboard every night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wistar, meanwhile, was answering
Moses’ shouts, calling out to him to keep
afloat, if he could, till they got to him.
Claiborne and Lincoln immediately put
out, rowing back against the stream, and
found the boy floating with both arms
clasped about the plank. He was wet and
cold, but otherwise uninjured.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But where is Lewis? Do you know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>anything about Lewis?” were Marion
Royce’s first questions when they had
Moses aboard.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moses could tell them little, however,
except that Lewis had been on the roof,
and that he thought he had heard him
shout, “You red scamp, you!” when the
landslide occurred, for such they now concluded
had been the cause of the accident.
The side of the bluff, and with it a number
of trees, had slid down into the river.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such subsidences of the banks are of
common occurrence in time of flood on the
Mississippi, owing to the undermining
action of the powerful current. Tracts,
many acres in extent, with the forest growing
thereon, are suddenly submerged.</p>

<p class='c011'>They succeeded in cutting away the tree
that fouled them, and then they moored
the ark against a willow bank three or four
miles below. Lewis’ disappearance had
filled the young captain with the gravest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>solicitude. It was feared that the tree had
struck and crushed him. It was now
noticed, too, that Tige was not aboard the
ark; and Moses remembered about hoisting
the dog to the roof a few moments before
the landslide occurred.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That tree knocked them both overboard,”
said Charlie Hoyt, with conviction,
and all were inclined to agree with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Royce would not go on, however,
till careful search had been made, and
as soon as day dawned he and Wistar, with
Charlie Hoyt and Lincoln, took the skiff
and pulled back up-stream to the bluff
whence they had been so roughly cast adrift.</p>

<p class='c011'>No trace of the missing boy was here discovered,
however; they landed, and climbing
up the bank, saw where the entire side
of it had collapsed, and a dozen or more large
cotton-wood trees had slid down. It was
one of the latter that had fallen aboard the
ark.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>The search alongshore, both above and
below, was continued for an hour or more,
and they shouted repeatedly, but obtained
no response. The conclusion forced on
the minds of all was that the boy had been
knocked overboard when the roof broke
down, and had been swept away by the
rapid current and drowned.</p>

<p class='c011'>On returning to the ark, Captain Royce
found that three or four hours’ work would
have to be done before going on. Two
horses were so badly crushed that it became
necessary to kill them. A third was slightly
injured, and was put in slings. To some
extent, too, the roof was patched up; but
when all was done, the old craft bore visible
evidence of rough usage.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not till past noon that they got
off from the willow bank and resumed the
voyage—with heavy hearts.</p>

<p class='c011'>By four o’clock that afternoon another
high bluff came into view down the river—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>third of that picturesque series known
to boatmen as the Chickasaw Bluffs.</p>

<p class='c011'>And this was ever afterward memorable
to our arksmen. As they drifted down
near it shouts were heard from the woods
crowning the river-front. The barking of
a dog also came to their ears. Two men
could be seen high up the bluff, and one of
them was swinging his arms as if making
signals.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe that’s Lewis!” Moses
shouted, in great excitement. “Lewis and
Tige!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But that other looks like an Indian!”
exclaimed Wistar.</p>

<p class='c011'>They scarcely knew what to think of it
at first, but as the ark floated past they made
sure that it was Lewis; and Captain Royce
at once ordered the men at the sweeps to
veer inshore. So swift was the current,
however, that the ark floated on for a mile
or more before a landing could be effected.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>But they had no more than carried a
line ashore to some willows, growing on a
low point, when Tige, barking joyously,
burst through the cane thickets, and was
followed a moment later by Lewis himself.
And with him—to the astonishment of the
arksmen—was a brawny Indian, decked out
after the manner of a Chickasaw chief, but
grinning broadly and holding up his right
hand in token of a peaceful intent.</p>

Lewis exclaimed, for Moses
was getting his rifle. “He’s
somebody you know. Guess

never guess! And he got me

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='small'>“GUESS WHO HE IS! GUESS!”</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c011'>He was incapable of another word. He
simply stood and stared.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jimmy!” shouted Moses, dashing past
into the cabin, “Jimmy! <i>Here’s your pa!</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion had mechanically reached out
and grasped the Indian’s hand and was
bewilderingly shaking it. As soon as he
recovered himself a little, he released it
and allowed Lincoln to follow his example.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lincoln spoke with much gravity.
“You don’t say,” he drawled. “No
wonder his robber friends told Jimmy that
his pa would know him by the resemblance,
when they fixed him up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>James Claiborne, or Sam Hokomoke,
drew himself up slightly, and the smile
died out of his face at this reference to his
having robber friends.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now you’ve offended him!” said
Lewis, angrily. “I tell you he’s a big
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>chief in his tribe, though he isn’t dressed
in his war togs.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh,” murmured Lincoln; “just a
social call. Well, we’re mighty glad to
see you, Sam Hokomoke, or James Claiborne,
whichever name you like the best,
and we know Jimmy will be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are very glad to have you here,”
said Marion, rousing from his stupefaction
to his responsibilities as captain. It was
almost impossible for him, any more than
for Shadwell Lincoln, to accept him as a
white man, like themselves. He had lost
all resemblance to a white man at first
glance. He was the color of seasoned
leather, and the fact that he had fallen into
the Indian ways of speech in his seldom
practised English, made it seem as if he
could not possibly understand everything
they said as easily as they understood one
another.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have missed you,” continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Marion, realizing that this was an absurd
way to state the case, but unable for the
life of him to think of a better one.</p>

<p class='c011'>James Claiborne grinned again. He
had said more already than he was
accustomed to, and apparently Marion’s
statement did not strike him as being in
need of any verbal acknowledgment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here’s Jimmy!” shouted Moses,
dashing out of the cabin in front of him,
like a herald before a royal pageant.
“Jimmy, here’s your pa!—Ain’t it the
greatest thing you ever set your eyes on?”
he whispered to Lincoln, as he squeezed
close in to the quickly thickening group.
“Think how Jimmy set out to find him,
and the dangers he went through, and the
suffering, and to have his pa just come
strolling aboard—and a regular Indian
chief!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess <i>I</i> had some hand in it,” said
Lewis, darting a scornful look at Mose.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“H’m! Might have knowed you’d be
grumbling because you ain’t the whole
show,” retorted the ever-ready Mose.</p>

<p class='c011'>Considered as a consummation, such as
Moses described it, the meeting between
Jimmy Claiborne and his father left a good
deal to the imagination. Jimmy had advanced
forward, thrust from behind, forcibly,
rather than moved by an impelling filial
emotion. Within arm’s length of the big
Indian he came to a dead halt. The
pressure from behind had withdrawn itself,
leaving him rooted to the deck. He was
face to face with his father, but it took a
shrewd physiognomist to discover it. James
Claiborne Hokomoke, on his side, made no
advance. The traditions of fifteen years
among the Indians may have made the
American observances strike him as inadequate
to the occasion. Perhaps he would
have preferred to hold some sort of council,
and sit in a circle for hours, before a word
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>was spoken on either hand. The arksmen
grew fidgety. Jimmy grew red. Some
intuition of this embarrassment evidently
stirred the white man’s brain in Hokomoke,
bringing with it a train of more or less
faded and obliterated memories.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You my son?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy hesitated. “I reckon I am,” he
answered, deprecatingly. He did not mean
to appear doubtful, but he was embarrassed.
A more positive answer would have seemed
to him pushing—like attracting attention
to himself. His eyes strayed imploringly
to Marion, but the young captain had
stepped back to give him the entire floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Humph! Ugly!” was his father’s
comment.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a moment of astonishment
at this unexpected sally. With his long
scalp and forelock and the rest of his hair
in half grown tufts, and the paint only
partly worn off his face, Jimmy’s appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>certainly was not such as to make a
parent proud. A great laugh went up from
the men, in which Sam Hokomoke joined
as heartily as any one, and with that laugh
the atmosphere of constraint cleared, and
Jimmy felt at ease.</p>

<p class='c011'>The white man, who had so unaccountably
turned his back on his family and
disappeared for so many years, was almost
indifferent to the news they poured into
his ears about Fish Creek and its people.
He asked no questions, but he listened with
some show of interest to the things they
told him of his father, and Maria, his wife.
He accepted the hospitality which Marion
extended him, but expressed no enthusiasm
when it was proposed that he should return
with them to Fish Creek in the autumn.
He made no further explanation of his reluctance
than might be gathered from the simple
comment, “Squaw good,” and he had no
messages for Maria, although to his father
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>he sent several long speeches, beautiful with
Indian symbolism and sentiment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But how on earth did you meet each
other, and where in the world have you
been?” asked Marion of Lewis, when they
were floating down the river again, and a
reserved relationship had established itself
between Jimmy and his father.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Been chasing along the bank,” replied
the boy. “I ran by you last night. Didn’t
you stop somewhere?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We stopped and went back to look
for you,” replied Captain Royce.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was when I went by you, and
didn’t know it!” exclaimed Lewis. “Then
after we had run a long way, Sam Hokomoke
climbed up that high bluff and saw
ye comin’ down-stream. And I tell ye I
was glad!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But how came you ashore in the first
place?” exclaimed Moses. “Did you jump
ashore when the tree fell on us?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>“No, I didn’t!” replied Lewis, shortly.
“I didn’t have a chance. I went head
foremost into the river! But that wasn’t
the first of it,” Lewis added. “The whole
bluff slid down to begin with, and Sam
Hokomoke with it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Didn’t I tell ye that there was someone
up there?” Lewis interrupted himself
to say to Moses. “Didn’t I say so?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You said you believed there was a
buffalo up there,” Moses admitted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I said ‘something’ was up there,”
insisted Lewis. “Well, ’twas Hokomoke”—somehow
it seemed impossible to call
him by the name of Claiborne. “He tossed
them little stones down to attract our attention,
just for fun, but when the bank caved
in he was as surprised as anybody, I guess,
for down he came with it, head first; but
he gave a mighty jump, and landed on the
ark roof, within three feet of me. I
thought he was going to scalp me, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>clinched him—for there was no chance to
get up my gun.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was that when you said, ‘You red
scamp, you?’” exclaimed Moses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe,” replied Lewis. “I don’t
know what I said. I thought he meant
me, and I clinched, and Tige jumped for
him, too. But just then something struck
us. D’ye say ’twas a tree? The whole
roof went smash, and Tige and me and
Hokomoke went heels over head into the
river.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess I’d ’a’ been drowned sure,”
Lewis continued, more soberly. “I went
down, down, down, and swallowed considerable
water. I thought I never’d come
up; but when I did, he had me by the
hair, and was makin’ for the bank with
me. He got out and pulled me out. I
thought he had only hauled me out to get
my scalp, and I tried to break away from
him. But he began to say, ‘Me no kill!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Me no kill! Me white man,’ Tige, too,
never once offered to bite him after we got
ashore.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As soon as I found I hadn’t got to
fight, I began to look for the ark,” Lewis
went on, “but it had gone. I hallooed
four or five times, but couldn’t hear anything
of you, though I heard somebody,
whose voice sounded like Mose’s, away
down the river. We sat and rested a while,
and then Hokomoke gave me a pull by the
arm, and said, ‘Me go catch white man’s
boat.’ And we started after you through
the swamps and cane—an awful place to get
through in the night. I don’t believe I
would ever got down here if it hadn’t been
for him. I told him about us, and then he
told me who he was. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In spite of their efforts to keep him
longer, Sam Hokomoke took leave of the
arksmen the next day at a camp of his tribe
near the fourth Chickasaw bluff.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“It’s cert’n’y curious,” said Jimmy, as
they watched him disappear, waving his
hand and grinning back at them, “to think
I have a father who is a full-fledged Indian
chief, and that I have an invitation from
him to visit him or call upon him for
assistance whenever I please.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The strangest part of it is that the
Spaniards have treaties with them against
us Americans, and that they’re our worst
enemies,” said Marion.</p>

<p class='c011'>No adventure worthy of note now befell
them for a number of days. They passed
the mouth of the St. Francis River and
many natural meadows, or prairies, at
several of which settlers’ cabins had recently
been built. Here they were sometimes
able to exchange corn and wheat for eggs,
poultry, bear meat and venison.</p>

<p class='c011'>In two days the mouth of the Arkansas
River was passed. At the new settlement
of Palmyra they tied up for a day and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>half, in order to obtain larger sweeps and to
mend the roof of the ark. The next day
the Grand Gulf Hills came in view, and
during the afternoon both Captain Royce
and Shadwell Lincoln found that all their
skill and experience barely sufficed to keep
their heavily-laden craft out of Grand Gulf
Eddy. For here the channel narrows, and
has a vast whirlpool on each hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was now the latter part of June, and
despite many perils and accidents, the ark
was getting well toward its destination.
But the night after they had passed Grand
Gulf proved one of the most exciting of
the voyage. No favorable place for tying
up to the bank had presented itself that
afternoon, but as twilight came on they
veered into a small bayou, which opened
into the forest on the eastern, or Mississippi,
shore.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such creek mouths were far from being
ideal stopping-places on account of mosquitoes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>which, at this season, tortured man
and beast almost beyond endurance. The
day had been very warm, and despite the
best that could be done for their comfort,
the live stock on the ark suffered exceedingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Only ten of the crew mustered at mess
that night. Corson had not yet recovered;
Clark MacAfee still complained of his injuries,
and Obed Hargous and Wistar Royce
were also ill from the effects of bad water.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a dismal place, this narrow
bayou, overhung with lofty trees, and the
gray, trailing mosses, which brushed the
roof of the ark. Around, on every hand,
thousands of frogs were croaking, while
here and there water-moccasins lay stretched
along dead cypress limbs that had fallen on
the stagnant waters. One was found on the
roof of the ark as the crew were tying up.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moses and Lewis made short work of
this intruder, and set lanterns forward and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>aft, the better to see if more snakes crept
aboard.</p>

<p class='c011'>While eating supper they could hear
the bellowing of alligators, which began
immediately after dark. The bayou appeared
to be a haunt of these formidable
reptiles. Alligators, indeed, seem to have
been far more numerous, as well as larger,
a century ago than at present. We now
rarely hear of one being seen above the
mouth of the Red River; but in early days
they were found as far north as New
Madrid and the mouth of the Ohio. If
we may believe the accounts given by boatmen,
an alligator twenty feet in length
was not an unusually large reptile in the
days of the Louisiana Purchase.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile the horses, frightened probably
by the sound, were snorting loudly. It
became evident that the reptiles smelled the
live stock. It was not believed at first that
they could clamber aboard; but fears of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>this soon arose, for one of the big reptiles,
having apparently climbed out on a fallen
magnolia, dashed for the side of the ark,
forward, where he struck his head so hard
as to cause a considerable shock to the
boat. This raised a great commotion
among the horses. The claws, or flippers,
of other alligators could be heard
constantly scratching the sides, and at
length the big fellow came tumbling over the
rail at the very heels of the horses.</p>

<p class='c011'>The uproar that followed can be imagined;
the men shouting, the horses
kicking and squealing, Tige barking, and
the pet bear growling in a savage chorus.</p>

<p class='c011'>As if terrorized into abnormal activity,
this alligator lashed right and left with his
formidable tail, and snapped savagely at the
legs of the horses and at the pike-poles
with which the crew attacked it.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the horses kicked the reptile
and it scuttled back against the bulwarks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>rattled, dashed headlong past the gun-room,
and jammed itself between a post there and
the rail. Here it stuck fast, and Captain
Royce, who had run to get a rifle,
approached and fired the piece into the
reptile’s gaping throat.</p>

<p class='c011'>No more of the saurians got on board,
or the voyage might have ended then and
there; but it was not till day dawned that
the scaly creatures began to sink, and swim
away to their coverts.</p>

<p class='c011'>At sunrise they poled out of the bayou,
and were glad to feel the ark floating with
the river again. But adventures and accidents,
as has been often noted, rarely come
singly. The current bore them over toward
the Spanish, or Louisiana shore, and
as the ark drifted past a bank of thick
willows, it was suddenly drawn into the
rapid outset of water through a crevasse.</p>

<p class='c011'>As is frequently the case along the
lower course of the Mississippi, the surface
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>of the river current is here higher than
the swamps lying adjacent to the banks,
inundating the surrounding country, and
either finding its way back to the main
stream, hundreds of miles below, or else, as
in the case of the Atchafalaya Bayou, reaching
the Gulf of Mexico by other channels.</p>

<p class='c011'>So vast is the quantity of alluvial mud
brought down by this mighty stream that
the river constantly exhibits a tendency to
deposit and raise banks for itself above the
level of the low country through which it
flows. From the nature of things, however,
these banks cannot go on increasing
in height beyond a certain well-marked
limit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Charlie Hoyt and Wistar Royce were
standing by the long sweep, or steering oar,
at the time, and Lewis Hoyt had just gone
forward on lookout duty. As they floated
past the willow bank a skiff with four
rowers, farther out on the river, came up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>and hailed them. Lewis turned to answer
and asked, “What news of the Spaniards?”</p>

<p class='c011'>As he listened for their reply he felt the
bow of the ark swing shoreward, and
glanced back at the steersmen. But Wistar
and Charlie were staring at him. He then
saw the gap in the bank and the water
surging through it—a gap no more than
fifty feet wide; but, before he could even
shout to the steersmen, the ark had headed
into it and was sucked through.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a hundred yards or more the torrent
ran with great force, then spread itself
over a submerged swamp of cane, willow,
and other small growth, amid the tops of
which the heavy craft went crashing its
way for fully a quarter of a mile before the
arksmen could check it.</p>

<p class='c011'>It came to rest, finally, on a ridge
thickly timbered with magnolia and live-oak
trees, in the midst of which was a
dense tangle of young bays and myrtle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>bushes and trumpet vines. Wedged securely
between a live-oak, whose great branches
swept the after-deck, and a tall magnolia at
the bow, like a pile at the end of a pier,
the ark was as securely docked as if it had
reached the end of its travels.</p>

<p class='c011'>It had all happened so suddenly that
when Captain Royce came out of the cook’s
galley, he was amazed to find the ark in a
hammock a quarter of a mile back of the
river.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Lewis,” drawled Shadwell Lincoln,
“you’re a boss pilot. Reckon our
voyage ends here. Looks as if we’d have
to foot it the rest of the way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Charlie Hoyt, Wistar Royce and Lewis
Hoyt stood staring at the disaster that their
negligence had wrought.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, shut up, can’t you?” said Moses.
“This ain’t any time for sarcasm. I guess
Lewis didn’t come in here on a pleasure
junket.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Lewis, surprised at having Moses siding
with him, cast a grateful look at him.
The extreme gravity of the situation, however,
was fully apparent to all. How to
get so heavy a craft back into the river was
a difficult problem. Once off the hammock,
all hands, working together, might pole the
ark back to the gap; but the strength of a
hundred men would hardly have sufficed to
force it against the torrent that poured
through the gap in the bank.</p>

<p class='c011'>MacAfee, who had made several voyages,
thought that in four weeks the river would
fall, and that perhaps by that time they
might be able to haul back into the Mississippi.
But Merrick and Kenton, and
Obed Hargous, boatmen of experience,
thought this unlikely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When we warp her out of this timber,”
said Marion, “she will be strained and
sprung so that we can’t keep her afloat.
Probably, we’ll have to unload and take her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>to pieces, and put her together again on
the river.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That will take months,” said Moses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One thing,” said Lewis. “The men
in the skiff told me that the Spaniards have
closed New Orleans. We couldn’t land
our goods, even if we got there. There’s
going to be a fight. The rivermen are
drilling at Natchez, and troops are coming
down from Kentucky and everywhere.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is that true?” asked Marion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I expect so,” said Lewis. “I don’t
see why they should make it up, do you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll take a skiff and go find out how
things stand,” said Marion. His confidence
for a moment had deserted him. He felt
obliged to get away from the men who
were looking to him to be told what to do
next. The heavy shock of having their
trip brought to so hopeless a termination
almost unnerved him. He had hoped so
much from this year’s voyage.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>He launched his skiff at the edge of the
hammock, Kenton and Moses shoving him
off, and rowed away across the flooded savannah
to the river bank.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he returned, he confirmed all
that the men in the skiff had told Lewis.
There was at present no outlet for the cargoes
that were collecting below Natchez.
The rivermen were preparing to fight. As
to the ark, he had talked to a number of
barge captains, and they had suggested a
project for getting the boat back into the
river, when it should have been warped off
the hammock.</p>

<p class='c011'>A week was spent in taking off the
horses, for whom a rude shelter was built
from the cabin timbers of the ark. Some
of the cargo was also unloaded. For
another week part of the crew were busy
in making harness from lines and hawsers,
which they had on board for moorings and
“cordelling,” while others cut down tall,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>high feathering pines to be used as rollers
under the ark. The live-oak was also cut
down and a way cleared for the re-launching.</p>

<p class='c011'>They christened the hammock “Ararat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When they were ready to get the ark
down into the swamp, the crews of two
corn-laden barges from St. Louis came
across to render assistance, bringing with
them hawsers and pulley-blocks.</p>

<p class='c011'>The great broadhorn was finally floated
on the submerged savannah, and it was
comparatively easy for the men to pole
back to the river gap, where the hardest of
their task yet awaited the arksmen. Here
the clumsily wrought harness came into
play again. Claiborne and Lincoln had
also contrived hames, roughly hewn out of
green willow wood.</p>

<p class='c011'>A strong post was set in the river bank,
on the south side of the gap. A section off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>the trunk of a large hollow tree was fitted
upon the post so as to revolve on it, for
hawsers to reeve round. Their supply of
line running short, three extra hawsers
were bought from passing boats, and a
double pulley-block constructed from seasoned
plank and two iron bolts.</p>

<p class='c011'>With such rude tackle, contrived
wholly by the ingenuity of the pioneers,
twelve of the horses were at length hitched
to a long hawser, reeved through the
pulley-block and running round the post,
and the ark was hauled foot by foot up
into the river.</p>

<p class='c011'>The St. Louis corn barges had gone on,
but other barges had been lying-by to
render such assistance as was in their power,
and they were on the point of giving a
cheer for the ark when they noticed that
all the labor spent upon her had been in
vain.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ark was sinking.</p>

“There’s a bottom plank ’most
ripped out of her!” shouted
Moses, coming on deck and
looking wildly about for
Marion. “She’s goin’
down!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t reckon she’ll
sink,” said Kenton; “but
she’ll be durn wet to sleep in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What did it?” cried Lewis.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sawyer, I guess, while she was comin’
through the gap. It was an awful pull.
Ain’t nothin’ left to show what done it,
now,” said MacAfee.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s a bayou a little way below
here that we can pole her into and lay
her up,” said Marion. “Let go the hawsers.
Lewis, you and Lincoln watch the
cargo and the horses. Get ashore. I don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>believe she can sink. Let go the lines—all
together—Claiborne, you and Kenton
and Mose man the sweeps. I’ll look out
forward. Watch the water, you fellows.
If she settles any further, call out. Give
us time to get off in the skiffs. I don’t
think she’ll settle much farther.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The ark had sunk to her gunwales, and
now floated like a raft. The whole crew
were on deck, excepting the two who had
been set ashore to watch the cargo and
horses. With her dismantled cabin piled
amidships, she looked a wreck indeed, and
excited much sympathy from the craft
that passed her. About a mile below, the
arksmen worked her into a flooded bayou,
up which they were obliged to pole for a
considerable distance before reaching shoal
water.</p>

<p class='c011'>On this bayou the arksmen, directed by
Marion, established a permanent camp.
The cargo was brought over by small boatloads,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>and some was loaded and brought
across by land on the horses, and stored in
a shelter which was built for it. There
were no means of re-shipping it by other
barges, for all the craft on the river were
loaded with their own freight; and, besides,
the port was still closed to the Americans.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this camp Marion overhauled the
great flatboat as well as he could, without
getting it out of the water, and so heavy
had been the damage done by the snag and
the strain of bringing the ark through the
gap that, as Moses said, the cross-bottoming
and closing of the seams was about as much
work as building two new flatboats.</p>

<p class='c011'>Weeks passed, and the stifling malarial
summer wore through. One after another
the men sickened with a local fever, against
which their familiar remedies seemed
powerless. They recovered, but the great
heat which made work during the middle
of the day impossible, kept them prostrated.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>The dews fell like rain every night, and
made sleeping on the ground, as they were
accustomed to doing in the northern woods,
more dangerous than they knew. The air
they breathed was full of heavy scents from
blossoming bays and magnolias.</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion realized, too late, that he had
been led by a forlorn hope into entering a
<i>cul de sac</i>. He kept up the spirits of the
men, however, and after nightfall led many
an excursion up and down the bayou, spearing
alligators by torchlight, from the skiffs.
The men enjoyed this, for there are few
more exciting sports, and it helped to keep
the alligators at a distance from the camp,
where they were too fond of coming at
night to look for garbage around the cooking
quarters, and terrify the horses and
Tige. His life, poor fellow, was not a
happy one. Jimmy had captured a baby
alligator, about two feet long, and was trying
to tame him in a little corral near the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>camp. Natural sin was deeply rooted in
his nature, however, and he and Tige, who
could not leave such small fry to scoff at
him unpunished, kept up a constant and
deadly warfare; and yet it ended in the
little reptile’s drooping away from too
much civilizing, until, like a flower out of
water, he withered up, his skin grew
cracked and dingy, and he died and was
buried with melancholy rites.</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion also sent the men fishing a good
deal, and they trolled all the way to the
head of the bayou after green trout, or
black bass, as they are called in the north.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was on one of these trips that the
boys made a curious discovery which
greatly excited the imagination of Moses,
and led Jimmy to think of something
which indirectly saved the fortunes of the
crew, and, in all probability, Marion Royce’s
life as well.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two were paddling up a branch of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>the bayou, which they had never explored
before. It was just sunrise, for they
usually made these expeditions about daybreak,
and brought back the camp’s breakfast.
The creek was very narrow—not
more than ten feet across from one high bank
to the other, but fully fifteen feet deep in
most places, and fed by many little springs,
which they could see purling at the bottom.
The still water at the surface was so
clear that they could see the clean sand and
the tufts of grass in which the fish hid,
motionless. After the months on the
dirty Mississippi, and the black waters of
the lower bayou, this little creek was a
marvel of delight to the boys, and they
paddled along, their blades brushing the
banks as they went.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s the first perfectly clear water
we’ve seen since we left home, isn’t it?”
said Mose. “My, don’t it make you
homesick?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>Jimmy shook his head. He had not
been homesick. The ark had been his
first real home. “Look!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moses looked, and saw, blocking the
little creek ahead of them, the ribs of an
ancient, many-oared galley. It rose, skeleton-like,
to the surface of the water, hung
with tatters that looked like sea-weed and
turned out to be rust-eaten chains. The
boys paddled up to it and felt them over,
dipping their arms in to the shoulder.
They could see it as clearly as if it had
been out of water.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Curious, ain’t it?” said Jimmy. “Escaped,
most likely, from Corsairs, or
Spaniards, or something. Wonder what
became of the crew?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let’s go ashore and look,” suggested
Mose.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a tiny strip of shelving
beach, up which they drew the skiff, and
then they wandered about the landing-place.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>“Here are some marks on these magnolias,”
said Moses, after prowling about
for awhile. “Right opposite each other.
A ship on this, and a square on the other.
Do you suppose there’s a treasure hid
between them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy studied the deep scars in the
smooth trunks attentively. “Uncle Amasa
always said that pirates didn’t bury treasure,”
he said. “They spent it all. No; I
reckon that’s just a mark to show where
the next fellows were to land, and what
they’d find when they got here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I bet there’s treasure,” said Moses,
excitedly. “Let’s come up here every
morning, and dig until we’ve dug all round
the landing, and see if we don’t find it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy looked at him with paternal
indulgence. “Don’t you get work enough
on the ark to suit you?” he asked. “Come
on into the woods a bit and see what they
meant by these marks.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>They went up a pine-needle-covered
slope and gained a tiny little cleared
plateau, and saw an orderly line of live fig
trees. If the boys had been southern born,
this might have told them that they were
looking at the place where people had
lived, but they knew nothing about the
habits of fig trees, and they did not even
guess that the late crop of brown fruit
which hung to the branches was good to
eat. Experience with sundry prickly pears
had made them cautious where they had at
first been venturesome, and they left the figs
alone. A few silvery boards strewed the
cleared ground, and at a little distance a
row of strange little wooden edifices, like
the dog tents of soldiers, were falling into
decay. Moses bent down and peered into
one of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, they’re graves!” he exclaimed,
in an awed voice. “I wonder why they
were covered like this.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“To keep animals from rooting up the
dead, I reckon,” answered Jimmy, who
was practical. “The people from the boat
must have come and lived here and waited
for their friends a long time, and died of
some fever, one by one, so that each fellow
was decently buried. That’s all I can
make of it, and I reckon that satisfies me.
Don’t it you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, it don’t,” said Moses, decidedly.
“I want to hunt for the treasure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy looked at the younger boy
thoughtfully, without answering. He saw
that the vision of treasure had filled Moses’
imagination so that the terrible parallel
that these lost graves and relics of a boat
foreshadowed, for their own desolate plight
farther down the bayou did not even occur
to him. Nothing could be gained by
pointing it out, moreover, so he kept his
peace. He examined the ground carefully,
and searched the bottom of the creek,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>when they finally returned to their skiff;
but the sands of many years had sifted back
and forth, and he saw nothing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mebby he got away,” he muttered,
“when there wasn’t any one left to look
after. Lord A’mighty, I hope so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who got away? What ye talking
about?” asked Moses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The last one, of course,” said Jimmy.
“We counted nine of those hen coops.
Some fellow must have buried the last one,
mustn’t he? We didn’t find any traces
of him anywhere, so I reckon when there
wa’n’t anybody left to look after, he got
away, and mebby lived to get somewhere.
I hope so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then he probably took the treasure
with him, if there was any?” asked Mose,
who was still cherishing visions.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy stared at him. “Oh, dod rot
you and your treasure,” he said, roughly. “I
mean—of course, he took it. Wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>“Sure—of course,” said Mose. But
this view of the case was a great blow to
his fancies, and they rowed down to camp
almost in silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>When they got back to the ark, Moses
was full of their discovery, and told the
men about the galley and the marks on the
trees, and discussed the possibility of
treasure. But Jimmy drew Marion aside
to propose a very different idea.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mack,” he said, abruptly, “I want to
take one of the skiffs and go to Natchez.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion lifted his head sharply. “What
for?” he asked. He was the color of clay,
and staggered as he stood. “What for?”
he repeated, sharply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m afraid I’ll lose my head if I don’t
go,” answered Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your head, man? What’s the matter
with you? Are you sick, too?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s the same as mine,” persisted
Jimmy. “The others can’t tell who shot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>him, but they’re all willing I should negotiate
for the crowd, because he gave me
the most trouble. I mean Big Harp—<i>his</i>
head. I want to take it to Natchez, and
give it over to the commandant at the fort
and have it stuck up on the palisades, so
that there won’t be so much outlawry along
the river for a while. I got to studyin’
about it up the bayou, and I think it’s
my duty. I oughtn’t to wait.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Was this Jimmy Claiborne? The boy
who talked about his duty to other rivermen?
Marion looked at him with a dawning
understanding of what the month among
the outlaws, and the months on the ark,
had been to the boy who had been condemned
at home. He knew nothing of the
way the incident up the bayou—which had
fired the younger boy with enthusiasm for
treasure hunting—had brought home to
this one what he owed to his fellows. And
the young captain stood silent, staring out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>of feverish eyes at the big fellow who faced
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jimmy,” said Marion, leaning back
against a magnolia, “do you know that
you’re the only man I can count on?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Me?” said Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, you. Kenton is around, and
that’s about all. He’s discouraged. MacAfee’s
discouraged. Merrick’s a pretty
sick man. I’m discouraged. Oh, boy,”
he broke off, “if you knew what a load
this expedition is to carry about on——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“On a chill?” suggested Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that’s it. On a chill. A band
of those ruffians who are loafing around
Natchez could come up here and wipe us
out—the way we stand. There’s Charlie
and Lewis Hoyt, and there’s Shadwell and
Moses and you, and that’s about all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He leaned against the magnolia and
thrust his hands deep in his pockets and
regarded Jimmy with a countenance so dismal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>that Jimmy felt himself stricken with
an icy foretaste of fear; not fear for his life
or limb, but that fear known as responsibility
for others, which he now realized
was the thing that most brave men carried
about with them, even when they slept.
Marion had carried it all through the voyage.
Was he laying it down?</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ll be all right by mid-day,” said
Jimmy, with outward cheerfulness. “You’ll
be all right, Mack. Don’t you go and
worry. Everything’s doin’ all right. The
men are gettin’ on pretty well. Corson
has his chill, and then about noon he gets
up and waters the horses. Every fellow is
able to do something. They ain’t knocked
out. Why, if any danger was to come
along it would brace ’em right up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion frowned. “I want you to
know how things are,” he said, a little
impatiently. “I don’t want you to think
things are all right, and then some morning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>have the whole load fall on you without
any warning, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He pulled himself up with an effort.
“If you go to Natchez, you’d better find
out from somebody who’s had experience
in this climate how they treat these fevers.
You’d better take Lincoln with you, for
you’ll probably have a fight on your hands.
There’s a rough crowd there, and if you’re
alone you’ll probably lose your ‘Big Harp.’
Find out everything you can about the
chances of deposit at New Orleans. The
commandant probably won’t tell you much,
but what he does say will have truth in it;
and all these rumors that we’ve been getting
have nothing definite, except that we can’t
deposit and ought to fight. The men
along the river don’t know any more about
the plans of the French than we do. I
hope there’s no fight coming; but if there
is, God willing, we’ll take a hand in it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You bet,” said Jimmy. He cleared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>his throat, because what he had to say
embarrassed him. “Mack,” he began, “I
reckon you know I’ll stand by you? If
you’re going to be sick, don’t you go and
worry. I’ll stand by the ark. I can put
the thing through. You can trust me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion smiled wearily. “You will be
captain, Jimmy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy flushed. His lip trembled.
“You’re the captain of this expedition,” he
answered in a voice that he tried hard to
make steady, “and captain you’re going to
stay, Mack, whether ye’re up or on your
back here in camp; and I’ll see that your
orders get carried out, that’s all. But don’t
you worry—you hear me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right,” said Marion. “I guess
we understand each other.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I reckon we do,” said Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The young captain moved away towards
the shelter of poles where Kenton
was feeding the horses. He walked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>unsteadily, and Jimmy saw him wipe his
forehead with the back of his hand. A
heavy weight settled on Jimmy’s heart.
And this was the man Jimmy had sworn to
be revenged upon, for forbidding him to
join the crew! At that moment, watching
him going off to look after the welfare of
the camp when he should have been in bed,
Jimmy would have welcomed the chance
of laying down his life for Marion Royce.</p>

<p class='c011'>If Marion should let sickness get hold
of him so that he could not command the
expedition, what would become of all of
them? In the crew there were but Marion
and himself who had the gift of leadership.
The others, efficient enough in other ways,
all had disqualifications for commanders,
and would quickly have brought the rest
of the crew to riot and mutiny and chaos.
The fact that Marion had been afraid of
Jimmy’s influence at the outset, pointed to
the influence which Jimmy had it in him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>to wield, for either good or evil, and now
Jimmy wondered that he had ever threatened
to cast it against law and order.</p>

<p class='c011'>He continued to turn it all over and
over in his mind through the process of
helping get the breakfast of fish and pot
porridge; and even after he and Shadwell
had provisioned their skiff and started down
the river towards Natchez, he continued to
think of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not communicate his thoughts
to Lincoln. No one ever confided in
Lincoln. He was too unsympathetic.
With his drawling indolence, he scoffed at
everything. Jimmy looked at him and
wondered if he had ever felt a responsibility.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” said Shadwell at length, returning
the look with one of languid
tolerance, “you’re most as talkative as your
pa. What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothin’,” said Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Old Mack’s petering out,” observed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>Shadwell. “Fussed like an old granny
about our getting off. You’d think we
were goin’ to New Orleans. Wanted to
have Lewis come along, at the last minute,
and leave them short-handed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy pulled away at the oars. “Good
thing, too, if we could have him,” he said.
“You just wait till it comes to pullin’
back; you’ll think so, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Lincoln lay back in the stern and
waved off the mosquitoes. A little later
in the day the breeze would come up and
blow them away for a time, but now they
swam in the sunlight like singing clouds.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dod rot ’em,” said Lincoln.</p>

<p class='c011'>They shot out into the river and the
current took Jimmy’s work away from
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Only two boats were floating down, but
from the crews of these they received much
disconcerting news.</p>

<p class='c011'>The climax of the long grievance had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>come. The Spaniards could no longer
arbitrarily keep the gate of the world closed
to the frontiersmen. For the West an outlet
was necessary at New Orleans. The
flatboats must unload there and deposit their
goods pending reshipment in sea-going
vessels. Ten years before, when the
Spaniards had denied this privilege, the
West had talked of war, and a treaty had
been made which gave the Americans the
right to unload their goods. The term
of the treaty had expired and the Spaniards
had withdrawn this right of deposit. All
was again chaos, rendered more formidable
by the great increase in the river
traffic. What with their market closed and
the talk of a French invasion, it was no
wonder that the rivermen were ready and
anxious to fight.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they neared Natchez they received
more news. Bonaparte, with a navy behind
him, was coming to colonize the Mississippi
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Valley as a “Grand French Empire of
the West.” Meanwhile, the arksmen who
ventured below Point Coupé—“the Line of
West Florida”—as it was called, would
probably be stopped by a Spanish battery,
recently planted there by the governor.</p>

<p class='c011'>The flotilla at Natchez was evidence of
the reality of this blockade. As Jimmy and
Lincoln wound in and out among the fleet
it seemed to them that the army which it
represented, all the way down to the line,
must overwhelm the Spanish troops if it
came to fighting. In fact, the arksmen
had little fear of the Spaniards. It was
Bonaparte and his General Victor whom
they feared.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Marietta brig was moored among
barges and broadhorns, and Jimmy soon
picked out a man he knew, who consented
to watch their skiff while they went ashore.
He expressed a good deal of curiosity as to
their errand, but Jimmy deemed it unwise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>to give any information, and made no
mention of the plight in which they had
left the rest of the crew and the ark.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sun was setting as they went up to
the fort and applied for admittance. On
the parade ground the flag was being
lowered, and the recruits who were drilling
had been formed to salute it. The notes
of a bugle died away. The little gun, on
the parapet overlooking the river, leaped
forward with a loud report.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can’t see the colonel,” said the
sentry, in answer to Jimmy’s request.
“Come to-morrow morning, after guard
mounting.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We must see him,” said Jimmy, looking
towards the dispersing group about the
flagstaff. “It’s important. We’ve got to
get back up the river to-night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The sentry looked at him stolidly, and
returned his musket to his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two figures came towards them: one,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>whom the boys saw was the commandant;
the other a civilian, a slender young
gentleman, dressed quietly in black. Without
further parley Jimmy started forward
to waylay them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Halt, you!” said the sentry. “I tell
you, you can’t see him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve <i>got</i> to see the commandant,” said
Jimmy, loudly, with his eyes fixed on the
nearing figures. “I’ve brought the head
of Big Harp, and I don’t want to leave the
fort with it. Some of the cut-throats
around here would be glad to break my
head in exchange for it, if I take it away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>His words reached the commandant, as
he had intended that they should, and he
and his companion looked up, Both men
appeared in rare good humor, which was,
doubtless, the reason for the attention which
the two arksmen received.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You wish to see me?” the colonel
asked. “You say you have Big Harp’s head?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come this way.” He led the boys out
of hearing of the sentry. “You will pardon
me, Governor,” he added to the young
gentleman with him, “but this is the fourth
time that Big Harp’s head has come to me
within the year. If a patriot had as many
heads to give for his country as an outlaw
has to have offered for ransom, our enemies
would never come to the end of them.
What proof have you, young sir, and, in
faith, who are you that you wear a scalp-lock
with a civil tongue? Your garments
bespeak the arksman from Kentucky, but
your head looks as if it might be forfeit,
like our friend’s here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aye, sir, it came near being,” said
Jimmy, smiling; “and to him, at that. But
since it had to be the one or the other, I’m
glad to have had it as it is.” He began
fumbling with the leather thong that tied
the bag he carried.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>“Oh, not so fast,” expostulated the
colonel. “It’s an ill sight to sup on. Governor
Claiborne, here, would be offering a
ransom for the return of his appetite. Let
it wait until to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Governor <i>Claiborne</i>?” repeated Jimmy.
He looked with astonishment on the young
gentleman in black.</p>

<p class='c011'>The governor looked back at him in
some amusement. “Well,” said the governor,
briskly, “what is it? I assure you there’s
no ransom just at present on <i>my</i> head, that
you should covet it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I beg your pardon, sir,” said Jimmy,
hastily. “I was surprised. <i>My</i> name is
Claiborne.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The devil it is!” said the governor.
“You do me too much honor. And what’s
the beginning of it? I didn’t know there
were any head-hunters amongst our family.
Where are you from?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“From Ohio,” said Jimmy. “We came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>from Virginia. Uncle Amasa, my grandfather,
is descended from William Claiborne.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see, cousins,” said the governor.
“Well cousin, my advice to you while you
are in Natchez is that you go and make the
acquaintance of the barber.” He put his
hand into his pocket and brought out some
silver pieces.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy drew back, flushing haughtily.
“We have to get back to our ark,” he said.
“We have left some very sick men up a
bayou just below the place where we were
shipwrecked. One of my errands was to
learn from some doctor who knows the
fevers how to take care of our sick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bearing of the two older men
changed at once. They asked questions of
Jimmy and Lincoln, and as one question
brought up another they eventually had the
history of the voyage from the moment of
Jimmy’s joining the crew, and Jimmy’s
anger cooled.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>“One thing I brought that I thought
might be sent on its way if you knew who
it was meant for,” he added, fishing in his
pocket. “It’s a letter that the outlaws
took from a despatch messenger that they
killed. They thought it had something
to say about money being sent by a brig
from Marietta, and they had me read part
of it. But when they found it was about
militia, they were disappointed and let me
keep the letter. Here it is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The outer addressed sheet was missing,
but the rest, including the sheet which
Jimmy had used for his message, was all
there, and as it was growing dark the colonel
unfolded a little pocket lantern, and putting
it together, stuck a candle in it, and read
the letter carefully. Then he handed it
to the governor, who also read it. They
looked at each other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I congratulate you,” said the colonel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you. But the purchase may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>not go through.” The governor turned to
Jimmy. “Have you read this letter, my
son?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They made me;—most of it, but as I
didn’t know who it was from nor who it
was to, I didn’t learn much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You didn’t recognize the signature of
President Jefferson, nor my initials, with the
dashes between them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed, sir, but I’d never happened to
hear of you at all,” said Jimmy, candidly,
“until the colonel here introduced you,
and I could not make out the signature.
Are you the one that’s to be picked out to
receive the territory from Napoleon Bonaparte
if the President buys it, as the letter
says he’s offered to? Faith, I’d like to see
that, sir. I’d like to be able to tell Uncle
Amasa that one of our folks had a hand in
such a thing as that. He’d be right proud
to hear it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The governor looked in stupefaction at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>the unmoved young arksman who spoke with
so little deference, and yet from such an
honest pride. Then he threw back his
head and laughed boyishly, loud and long.
The colonel, after glaring a moment, also
threw his head back, and Jimmy, after looking
doubtfully from one to the other, joined
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll bear it in mind,” the governor said.
“If there is anything to see, by Jupiter, you
shall see it, and more thereafter. But now,
colonel, how about the sick men up the
bayou? They must be gotten out of there.
Can’t we send up some men and put them
aboard their ark and fetch them out where
they’ll have a chance for life and limb?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We certainly will,” said the commandant,
and they were soon deep in ways and
means.</p>

<p class='c011'>The head of Big Harp the colonel delivered
to an orderly whom he called to
him, to be guarded until morning, when it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>should be displayed on the Natchez trace,
as a warning to all outlaws and a protection
to the pioneers along the river.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The bounty will be paid to you,” he
promised Jimmy, as he sent the two boys
away in command of a barge-load of men
and a surgeon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d rather not take it, sir,” said Jimmy.
“It would be blood money. Spend it in
making the river safer for the arksmen.
I’m mighty grateful to you for arranging
to get us out of the bayou with our cargo,
and if we can land it at New Orleans and
sell it and get home with all safe, we’ll
count ourselves lucky enough.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The river is open,” said the colonel.
“You’ll have no trouble with the Spaniards.
They got frightened when they heard about
the Independent Army you arksmen were
organizing, and have restored the right of
deposit. But with all this rumor of a
French invasion threatening, no one will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>buy goods. I’m afraid we can’t help you
there, so you’d better accept the money,
though your unwillingness does you credit,
I’ll be bound.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d rather not, sir,” answered Jimmy,
“and the others didn’t have half as much
trouble with him as I did. I’d rather you’d
use it to protect the rivermen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The governor, who was still with them,
clapped his hand on Jimmy’s shoulder.
“You’re one of us, all right,” he said. “The
colonel will keep it in trust for you, to buy
land—or get an education at the University
of Virginia, where the rest of the family
have gotten their learning. Would that
suit you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve got plenty of land,” said Jimmy,
doubtfully, “and I expect I’d never come
to be governor even if I went to the University.
I reckon it had better go into
protection for the arksmen along the river.
I’ll be comin’ down occasionally myself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>and I’d like to feel that my money is out
keepin’ watch along shore somewhere, or
else helping to fit out explorers in the wilderness,
like Uncle Amasa’s always pining
to. I reckon that would suit me best.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, well, we needn’t equip an expedition
with it now,” said the colonel.
“Good luck to you, and <i>au revoir</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Goodbye,” said Jimmy, “and thank
you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Goodbye, cousin! See you in New
Orleans,” shouted the governor.</p>

Although the commandant
had told Jimmy that
the river was open, the
ark had yet to hear
from the Spanish intendant.</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion Royce was
down with the fever when he was helped
aboard and the voyage resumed, and Jimmy
took his place, in a measure, and there was
no demur. Even Shadwell Lincoln showed
him a sarcastic deference since the interview
with the governor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Night and a dense fog covered the river,
when they reached the line of West Florida.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly, as the ark floated downward,
its headway was slowly arrested, and they
heard the jangle of a bell ashore. The ark
came to a standstill.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>Lewis, who was leaning over the port
bow, heard the dull swish of the current
against a cable, and saw that a raft of driftwood
had already collected against it. He
dropped on his knees and started to crawl
aft to report.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before he was half-way there, however,
there was a dull red flash in the fog, accompanied
by a tremendous report, and a
cannonball howled over the ark. So startling
a salute might well have caused confusion,
but the pioneer arksmen did not
lack coolness in danger. The horses, indeed,
jumped and made some noise, but not
a man spoke; and Lewis, reaching Jimmy,
whispered his news.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had hardly done so when a second
red flash and report followed. They heard
this ball skipping on the water ahead of
them. Still another gun roared its hostile
salutation, soon followed by a fourth report;
and but for the poor shooting of the Spanish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>gunners, it must have gone hard with the ark.
But, meanwhile, Jimmy was not idle.
Swinging down from the port bow, he
found that he could touch the cable with
his foot. It was a strong line; but glad
to find that it was not a chain, as he had
at first feared, he sent Moses for a large,
sharp knife from the cook-room. Then,
bidding Wistar and Lewis bear a hand at a
line which he looped round his own body,
he reached down, and after several efforts,
cut the hawser.</p>

<p class='c011'>It parted with a splash, and immediately
the ark floated on, silently as before. Four
or five more shots were fired, but all went
wide of the ark; the gunners appeared to
think that the enemy was farther down-stream.</p>

<p class='c011'>After passing the Spanish battery, the
ark floated on during the remainder of the
night, and until eight or nine o’clock the
following morning, when, the fog clearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>away, they found themselves heading down
a narrow passage between two islands.
Being still apprehensive of capture, they
tied up under cover of a wooded bank in
this narrow arm of water.</p>

<p class='c011'>No one came off to them here, although
they saw several boats in the channel outside
the islands; and that night they went
on again by moonlight, but had much
difficulty at a succession of great eddies in
the river. In one of these the ark floated
round and round for an hour or more
before they could row out of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very few boats were seen that day, and
these few were mostly market-boats, plying
to and fro between the city and the numerous
large plantations on both banks. Moses
and Lewis had never seen such fine places
before. There were extensive gardens of
vegetables and flowers, and the plantation
houses looked palatial to their unaccustomed
eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>What astonished them still more was
that the river was so much higher than the
fields of cane and cotton on each side of it.
When floating near the bank they could
look down on the gardens from the ark roof.</p>

<p class='c011'>Toward morning of the third night
they arrived within a mile and a half of the
city. As Jimmy had determined to go on
in advance that day, to make inquiries as to
the real condition of affairs, the ark was
moored to what, in the dusk of the early
morning, was believed to be a wild-wood
bank.</p>

<p class='c011'>After tying up, Lewis and Moses jumped
ashore to look about them. They had
gone but a few steps, however, when they
found themselves in a grove of thick trees,
with yellow balls showing amidst the dark-green,
glossy leaves.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oranges, aren’t they, Lew?” Moses
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Guess so,” said Lewis, doubtfully.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“Must be. Wonder if they are wild, or
do they belong to somebody?”</p>

<p class='c011'>They had heard oranges described, but
had never tasted one. A few steps away
there was what appeared to be a green
hedge, having numerous gaps in it; beyond
were more of the thick, dark-green trees
with the scattered yellow fruit.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two boys now advanced to one of
the gaps in the hedge, but had scarcely
peeped through when a little bareheaded
lad and a tall, black-eyed girl stepped out
from a covert.</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl said something to them,
laughing heartily; something in a rapid,
tripping tongue, which they did not in the
least understand. Moses afterward said that
it sounded like, “<i>Bonesure-messr-may-voo-venny-arboner!</i>”—which
may have been,
“Good morning! You have called early!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Like most boys in pioneer days, Lewis
and Moses were not very bashful. Seeing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>that the girl was laughing, they laughed in
turn, and pointed to the small yellow globes
in the trees. Thereupon the little lad
picked up several oranges, and gave them
each one, with a bow and flourish of his
hand. Moses thumbed his as if it had been
an apple, then essayed to take a big bite
from it, with the result that the juice flew,
some of it into his own eyes!</p>

<p class='c011'>Noting this, the girl laughed heartily.
Moses, winking hard, was inclined to make
angry remarks; but the boy, approaching
with grave politeness, showed the newcomer
how to pull off the peel. He also peeled
an orange for Lewis, and invited them to
be seated on a bench near by. There was
a house not far off, half-hidden by trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>A stout, dark-haired man appeared, with
a huge yellow and white dog, that sniffed
the strangers and then wagged his tail. The
man drew near and said, “<i>Buenas días!</i>” and
asked what appeared to be an abrupt question.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Moses nodded at a venture, although
he did not understand a word, but Lewis
shook his head. The dark man looked
perplexed and angry; but the girl said something
about “Norah,” to which the man
replied—still to quote from Moses—“<i>Ah—see—Norah.</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl ran away again, but soon
returned with a tall, austere woman, whose
auburn hair was turning gray. The woman
glanced hard at the boys, and with a strong
Irish accent said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The señor general wishes to know
where you came from and what you are
doing here, for sure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Lewis replied that they had come down
the river on an ark, and that they had seen
the oranges on the trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We did not come to steal them,”
Moses added, honestly enough. “We will
go right away if you say so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The woman smiled broadly, then turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>and repeated what they said in Spanish.
The small lad, meanwhile, was peeling
more oranges for them. But the man
cried out as if in much excitement, and the
woman asked them gravely when they had
come down the river.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Last night,” replied Moses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We always float by night when there
is a moon,” Lewis explained, to help out
Moses’ statement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Norah” interpreted, and the man
grew even more excited.</p>

<div id='i287'  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/i287.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='small'>“HOW GOT YE BY THE FORT?”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Irishwoman fell to laughing.
“But, sure, his honor wants to know how
ye got by the fort?” she said to the boys.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fort?” said Moses, inquiringly, and
looking hard at Lewis. “‘Fort?’” he repeated.
“We didn’t see any fort”—which
was literally true; there was too much fog.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the man fairly jumped at this
reply, and sputtered angrily.</p>

<p class='c011'>Little wonder, for this short, dark man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>was the Spanish intendant of New Orleans,
Señor Morales himself, the same who had
ordered the embargo! He had chanced to
be spending the night at the up-river house
of a French Creole friend, Doctor Lecassigne,
whose children our youthful arksmen
had found in the orange-orchard. That an
ark had floated past his fortifications and
never even seen them was not flattering to
Señor Morales’ pride!</p>

<p class='c011'>Doctor Lecassigne, a lean, sallow man,
who had now come from the house, sought
to soothe the irritation of his distinguished
guest. Norah, meanwhile, was asking the
boys what they had brought in their ark
and what they had seen on the way.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure I was once in Philadelphia
mesilf,” she said. “And a fine, brave
gintlemon was Gin’ral George Washington!
Many’s the toime I’ve handed him his
coffee. Ah, sure,” she added, “I’ve lived
in ivery part of the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>The boys rather liked old Norah.
Lewis told her of their nocturnal battle
with the alligators; and, not to be outdone,
Moses threw in an account of his Indian
“Gobbler,” and the great bones which they
had brought for Doctor Buchat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Doctor Buchat!” cried Norah. “Sure,
he must be a frind of me master here,” and
she spoke to Doctor Lecassigne, who became
interested at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>He went to call Señor Morales again,
and immediately they both expressed a
great curiosity to see the bones. The boys,
therefore, led the way back to the river,
where the ark lay moored.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy had already set off along the
levee for the city; but Shadwell Lincoln,
who had as usual been left in charge, threw
out a plank for them all to come on board.
He was a good deal disturbed, however,
when Lewis whispered to him that the
short, dark man was the hated intendant.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>Of the mastodon skeleton on the ark
roof, there still remained seven or eight of
the long ribs, the huge skull, femur bones,
one long, curved tusk and many of the
smaller bones. Both Doctor Lecassigne
and General Morales examined them in
astonishment at their enormous size. They
sent back to the house for Norah to interpret,
and asked a great many questions. The
intendant seemed now to forget his anger,
and assented good-humoredly when Doctor
Lecassigne proposed that the ark should be
allowed to remain there till he could send
for Doctor Buchat, who seems to have been
a friend of both.</p>

<p class='c011'>Doctor Lecassigne, who was a very genial,
kind-hearted man, went into the cabin
to see how Marion Royce and the other
sick men were coming on, and his favorable
report, especially of the captain, gave the
utmost relief to the crew. He then showed
them a better place to moor their craft, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>a short canal which opened through the
levee a little way below his house. A
water-gate at the end of this little canal
allowed a stream to flow from the level of
the river down to a mill for grinding corn
and sawing lumber. There were numbers
of such mills along the levees, the millstreams
flowing out of the river instead of
into it, presenting the odd spectacle of creeks
flowing backward from their mouths till their
waters were lost in the swamps at a distance.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Jimmy returned he was surprised
and a little startled to learn that in his absence
they had had Señor Morales for a
visitor. The intendant had already returned
to the city in his barge; but Doctor Lecassigne
assured them that although the
intendant was a somewhat choleric man
and inclined to narrow political views, he
would probably give them no farther
trouble, particularly if they were to send
him a present of a showy horse.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>This overture they concluded, rather reluctantly,
to make; and since Lewis and
Moses had seen and spoken with the general,
it was judged best that they should
take one of their handsomest animals to his
house in the city that very afternoon.</p>

<p class='c011'>They set off, accordingly, leading a large
bay horse—one of their very best. Meanwhile
Doctor Buchat had arrived to see
his long-expected mammoth bones, which
proved even bigger than he had been told.
But his disappointment that the skeleton
was not complete was keen, and he was
willing to pay but four hundred francs for
what Marion Royce had brought.</p>

<p class='c011'>The New Orleans of that day extended
for about a mile along the river-front, and
was surrounded on the back or land side
by a ditch or moat, filled with water, and
inside this ditch by a row of tall pickets,
consisting of cypress logs driven into the
earth close together. On this side, leading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>out into the back country, were two gates
with drawbridges; on the levee by the
water there was another gate, both above
and below the town.</p>

<p class='c011'>The people were chiefly French and
negroes, with a small Spanish and American
population, and the number of inhabitants
is said to have been ten thousand.</p>

<p class='c011'>At each gate there was a battery of
cannon, and along the river-front were a
number of larger guns, deemed very heavy
ordnance for the times. Negro slaves did
the work of stevedores along the levee.
Several hundreds of them were constantly
to be seen at the latter place, and when not
at work the rival gangs beguiled the time
dancing, singing, and sometimes fighting
pitched battles. It was all very novel to
Moses and Lewis—the palisades, the cannon,
the drawbridges, the long rows of
houses and the gay shops. But, although
strangers, they experienced little difficulty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>in finding the intendant’s house. For, on
mentioning his name to a group of young
darkies, the latter, mightily pleased at sight
of the horse, led the way there of their own
accord.</p>

<p class='c011'>Señor Morales was not at home, however,
and they had to content themselves
with giving the horse in charge of his equerries,
with Captain Royce’s compliments.
Their errand accomplished, it would have
been better if they had returned at once;
but they wished to see the town, and set
off on a long tramp through the streets.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even in 1803, with a population of
only ten thousand, New Orleans was a gay
and picturesque little city. Lewis and
Moses found so much to see that the shades
of evening surprised them while they were
still wandering along the streets.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was no more than a mile and a half
along the levee to the ark, however. The
boys continued on, peeping into the candle-lit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span><i>cabarets</i>, coffee-houses and verandas,
where gaily attired people were talking,
singing and playing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently, however, a <i>sereno</i>, or patrol,
stopped them, on account of their pioneer
dress, perhaps, and said a great deal which
they did not in the least understand. His
tone and manner were so censorious that
Moses thought they had better turn back.
Accordingly they hastened to the gate
near Fort St. Louis, by which they had
entered, but found it shut. A watch-fire
burned in the street near it, and a soldier
in uniform, with musket and bayonet, was
walking up and down before it.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they drew near this sentry, he
shouted: “<i>Centinela alerta!</i>” at the top of
his lungs—the usual fifteen-minute cry of a
Spanish soldier on guard duty.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the boys thought that he had
shouted to them, and were startled by his
vehemence.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>The soldier continued on his beat, but
looked hard at them; and not to provoke
him into shouting like that again, the boys
went back a little way to see what would
happen next.</p>

<p class='c011'>Something happened immediately. From
out a side street near the <i>palisadoes</i> they
heard a little bell ringing, and saw a queer
procession coming—two tonsured men in
black robes, who bore a black banner and
a kind of a tray; while behind them, at a
rapid pace, trotted four or five attendants,
each carrying a lantern. Bringing up the
rear were twelve soldiers, having muskets
and bayonets fixed.</p>

<p class='c011'>These, most likely, were Spanish priests,
proceeding to a military execution. Moses
and Lewis were apprehensive lest the soldiers
might be looking for them, and promptly
scudded to the cover of several long tiers of
molasses hogsheads on the levee.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ominous procession passed, however;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>and, satisfied now that they were not
objects of pursuit, Lewis and Moses came
out from their hiding-place and followed.
Walking rapidly, priests and soldiers proceeded
to the <i>Plaza de Armas</i> (now Jackson
Square), passed the <i>Cabildo</i>, <i>aduana</i> and barracks,
and went to the <i>calabozo</i>, or prison,
in the rear.</p>

<p class='c011'>Several hundred people had collected
here, and there were also numbers of soldiers
and three serenos with torches. Way was
made for the strange procession. When it
stopped before the prison door the by-standers
drew back, and every one sank on
his knees with bowed head—every one except
our two youthful pioneers from the
Ohio. They had no idea what it was all
about, and simply stood still.</p>

<p class='c011'>Immediately attention was attracted to
their irreverent attitude. One man whispered
to them brusquely, and attempted to
pull Moses down. Not understanding a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>word, and resenting having hands laid on
him, Moses gave him a push. The stranger
insisted. Moses pushed him headlong.
Lewis, too, squared about to assist his companion.
Thereupon two soldiers attempted
to seize him. Lewis promptly clinched
with the one nearest, and cross-locking his leg,
threw him heavily to the ground. Moses,
too, proved more than a match for the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our two young arksmen broke away
and ran through the crowd, shoving the
people right and left. But a sereno caught
hold of Moses, and as he was unable to
break loose again, they secured him, and
with many threats and buffets, hustled him
away to a circular wooden structure, hard
by the calabozo. This was the “little
calabozo,” which the Creoles called the
“calaboose,” answering to our lockup, or
police-station. Moses was thrust in without
ceremony, and found himself in very
undesirable company.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>Lewis meanwhile had broken through
the crowd and started off at a rapid run.
Several soldiers, serenos and others, chased
him hotly, and shouted savage orders after
him in Spanish, none of which he in the
least comprehended.</p>

<p class='c011'>When it came to running, Lewis was
quite at home; they could not catch
him. All along the water-front the chase
continued, and Lewis was getting well away
when he came to the palisadoes, by Fort
St. Louis, where they projected into the
river.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finding himself likely to be cornered
here, he was about to double back on his
pursuers when he saw a number of skiffs
drawn up in a row. To shove one of them
off was but the work of an instant. There
was a paddle in it, and he got clear of the
levee before the serenos could reach him.
They hailed the sentry at the gate, however,
and he, running up, touched off his gun.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>But by this time Lewis had paddled out
past a five-oared galley which lay near the
bank. Keeping outside this and several
other craft that lay crowded along the levee,
he escaped up-stream and returned to the ark.</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Royce was disturbed when he
learned that Moses had been made a prisoner.
He knew the ways of the Spanish
authorities well enough to understand that
nothing could be done for a captive until
the following day, and that to obtain Moses’
release was a problem. It was suggested
that the best method of procedure would
be to go to the prefect, or <i>alcalde</i>, the next
day, with a substantial present.</p>

<p class='c011'>As it chanced, however, the present was
not needed. Moses succeeded in solving
the problem himself. He found himself in
disagreeable company—ten dirty negroes,
thieves and fighters, some of them intoxicated;
a number of French sailors, a few
Mexicans, and a pirate or two from below
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>the Belize. This motley crew received him
with open arms and a shout of sinister welcome.
They passed him round, picked
his pocket, and even tried to strip him of
his leather jacket, moccasins and coonskin
cap.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Moses had not been a fighter all his
life without learning something of the science
of self-defense; and finding that he was
being stripped, he hit out at his tormentors
with such force that they stood away from
him, objurgating him for <i>un mauvais Kaintock</i>.
Others stole upon him in the obscurity,
and for an hour or so Moses was in
his natural element.</p>

<p class='c011'>What light there was came from a lantern
suspended from a peg in a wooden
post at the center of the enclosure. This
post apparently supported the roof. After
a time Moses backed against it and stood
there on the defensive.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the night advanced many of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>prisoners lay down and slept; but the young
arksman leaned against the post listening to
all that went on. What would be done
with him in the morning caused him
anxiety.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lantern went out at last; the
candle was consumed; and after a time he
caught the twinkle of a star through a
chink in the roof of the building. It was
near the top of the post, and led the boy to
think that the roof was not very thick or
strong there. He was accustomed to climbing
trees; it occurred to him that he might
break out, and he clasped the post with his
arms and “shinned” up.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had twelve or fifteen feet to climb
before his head bumped into the roof. It
did not feel very solid, and pressing his
head up against it, he began giving upward
pushes, grasping the post hard and jumping
up. One of the covering boards yielded,
and reaching up with one hand, he pushed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>it aside, got his head through the hole,
and then climbed out on the roof.</p>

<p class='c011'>His operations had created a hubbub
among his fellow prisoners below; clods
and old bones flew about his legs, but he
could hear no stir outside. So, sliding
down to the eaves of the calaboose at the
back—for he thought there was a sentry at
the gate—he swung off, dropped to the
ground, and decamped forthwith.</p>

<p class='c011'>He ran out toward the levee. A sereno,
with his lantern, was walking to and fro;
but Moses easily kept away from him, and
stealing along the encumbered levee up-stream,
came to the palisadoes by the fort,
as Lewis had done earlier in the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>The row of skiffs here attracted his
attention, and deeming his own need great,
he was not slow in appropriating one. The
river current was so strong, however, that
he was fully two hours paddling the skiff
against it, up to the ark. Day was breaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>as he reached it. Thus ended the two
boys’ first visit to the Crescent City in 1803.
The skiffs were returned to their places
that afternoon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The weather was hot; fevers prevailed,
and Marion Royce had not recovered
enough to dispose of his cargo. A great
number of arks, flatboats and other up-river
craft, came down to the city. The water-front
of the “American quarter” for a
mile was crowded with boats, and the town
was so thronged with frontiersmen that the
Spaniards had difficulty in maintaining even
the semblance of law and order.</p>

<p class='c011'>It must be confessed that Señor Morales’
reluctance to have American craft make
New Orleans their market was not wholly
unreasonable. The little city was in
turmoil night and day. Roisterers were no
sooner arrested and put in the little calabozo
than a mob of their fellows collected and
set them free. At last, to save themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>further trouble, the boatmen pulled the
little calaboose down. They were so
numerous and aggressive that the Spanish
dared not interfere with them in earnest, lest
they should take full possession of the town.</p>

<p class='c011'>The wide-awake French population
had grown very restless. These people had
little fondness for the Spaniards, and ardently
longed for the appearance of the French
fleet. Equally they disliked the frontiersmen.
“Napoleon will make you hop very
soon,” they said to the Americans in the
Creole “gombo,” or <i>patois</i>. “General
Victor is already at sea. When he arrives
you will all toe the mark.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Doctor Lecassigne and Doctor Buchat
remained Marion Royce’s warm friends,
however. The ark had not moved from
its berth in the canal near the plantation
house of the former. Here, too, they
often saw Señor Morales, and once met the
aged Governor Salcedo.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>News had already come that Spain had
ceded West Florida and Louisiana to
France. The Spaniards were merely awaiting
the arrival of French officials and a
garrison. The Creoles had grand anticipations
of what New Orleans would be as the
capital of the new French empire.</p>

<p class='c011'>In point of fact there had been another
and more extraordinary change. President
Jefferson had commissioned Livingstone
and Monroe to buy New Orleans and a small
strip of land at the mouth of the Mississippi.
But, while the negotiations were under way
in Paris, Napoleon changed his mind. Suddenly,
through Talleyrand, he offered the
whole of Louisiana to the Americans, and
the offer was finally accepted. The sale
had already been made—April 30th, 1803.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even after the news of the sale arrived,
the people would not credit it. “Napoleon
never gives up anything,” they said. “His
fleet will come at Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>But this was one of the cases where
Napoleon gave up something. He dared
not send a fleet to New Orleans, for the
reason that England, with whom he was
at war, had a stronger fleet than his in the
West Indian waters.</p>

<p class='c011'>On November 30th the banner of
Spain was lowered for the last time at the
Cabildo, and the tricolor of France went
up in its place. But the sight of it
brought little joy to the Creoles, for the
rumor of the transfer of Louisiana to the
United States was now confirmed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The French were taking possession
merely to legalize the transfer. General
Victor and the fleet were not coming.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the Spanish troops were now withdrawn,
and the French representative had
no troops with him to police the city, lawlessness
would have held full sway if the
arksmen and rivermen had not offered their
services to M. Laussat, and, forming a volunteer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>company, patrolled the streets day
and night, in armed bands. These were
stirring times for the arksmen from Fish
Creek. Marion was about again, and
Jimmy was everywhere in evidence, jealously
guarding the city as if he were its
sole custodian until the arrival of the
American commissioners, Wilkinson and
Claiborne. He knew, now, that the letter
he had carried so long had held the first
intimation to the governor that he would
be chosen, in case the purchase was successfully
brought about, to receive it from
France. To whom the letter was addressed,
Jimmy never knew; but it was evidently to
some close personal friend of the President’s
and the young Governor of Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c011'>City life had made some change in
Jimmy’s appearance. He had taken the
governor’s hint and visited the barber. His
own heart was so jubilant that he marveled
at the despair of the Creoles. Women, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>even men, were seen weeping in the shops
and doorways. To them this transfer was
but one more mocking irony of fate.</p>

<p class='c011'>The time fixed for the entrance of the
commissioners and the American troops was
Tuesday, December 20; but the great event
began for Jimmy the evening before, when,
walking out by the Gate of France to the
ark, he met Governor Claiborne and the
French commissioner, M. Laussat, returning
on horseback from a visit to one of the
plantations.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By Jupiter, but it seems to me that I
see my young cousin from up the Ohio,”
exclaimed the governor, reining in his
horse. “Monsieur Laussat, permit me to
present a young kinsman of mine from the
West.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He turned to his companion, and at that
moment a bullet whizzed past his head.
Turning back quickly, he saw that Jimmy’s
upflung hand had caught the wrist of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>swarthy little Creole. The pistol fell from
the Creole’s hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You would, would you?” said Jimmy,
pinning him, now that he was unarmed, and
taking him by the throat. “What shall I
do with him, sir? He tried to shoot you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The governor looked down at the dark-skinned
little partisan who had tried to kill
him. “He seems to have no love for the
idea of an American occupation,” he said.
“I hope the city isn’t full of such patriotism
for France. Let him go, cousin. My
friend,” he added to the Creole, “if you
were as good an American as you are a
Frenchman, I would like to have a thousand
of you at my back. As it is, I will
ask you to walk in front of us; is it not so,
M. Laussat?”</p>

<p class='c011'>To Jimmy he held out his hand. “You
are always goodness itself,” he said. “You
will come to me to-morrow at the Cabildo?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” murmured Jimmy. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>he had no idea of doing so. He and the
volunteer company would have their hands
full in the Place d’Armes, preserving order.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next morning the American troops
approached in order of battle, to be received
by the Spanish troops at the city gates.
They were escorted to the Cabildo, where
the keys of the city were handed to Claiborne,
and the people were absolved by
Laussat from allegiance to the French
Consul. Commissioner Claiborne then
welcomed them as citizens of the United
States. The commissioners then passed out
into one of the balconies and looked down
on the cheering crowds that gazed up at
them from the Place d’Armes. No other
fanatic attempted to kill the representative
of the new government, but Jimmy, among
his volunteers, watched anxiously, as if the
safety of the young man in the gallery
depended upon him alone.</p>

<img src='images/i314.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='small'>IN ITS PLACE ROSE THE STARS AND STRIPES</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Slowly the tricolor of France was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>lowered, and the Stars and Stripes raised
until they met midway of the flagstaff and
were saluted. Then the flag of the United
States rose, to the accompaniment of a great
cheer from thousands of boatmen and
soldiers, and New Orleans was an American
city for all future time.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the transfer came the hoped-for
improvement. Within three weeks Captain
Royce was able to dispose of nearly everything
at fair rates, even to the old ark itself,
in which they had come so far. Its sound
oak planks went to repair the gun platforms
and casemates at Fort St. Charles. And
for little more than he received for these,
Marion Royce had an opportunity to purchase
a small “keel” boat of fifteen-tons
burden for the homeward voyage.</p>

<p class='c011'>A difficulty now rose, however. The
horse-gear for the paddle-wheels, which
they had brought for the return trip up the
river, was too heavy for the keel. It required
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>six horses, walking round on a kind
of gallery, to operate the transverse shaft to
which the paddle-wheels were attached.
The keel was too narrow for a six-horse
“circuit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Horse-boats were not uncommon on the
Mississippi in those days; but most, if not
all, of these devices consisted of a large
horizontal wheel, round which the horses
walked, as sailors walk round a capstan, the
horizontal wheel being connected by cog-gear
to the shaft beneath, which carried
the two paddle-wheels.</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion Royce now set his wits at work
to devise something lighter and less cumbrous,
adapted to his small keel. His two
good friends, Doctor Lecassigne and Doctor
Buchat, were much interested, and spent
several days studying the problem with
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>But a Yankee sea-captain, named Grover,
who chanced to be in port with his Boston
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>brig, had the honor of suggesting to them
a horse-power of the treadmill type, such as
is now so commonly used for thrashing
grain and sawing wood, where the weight
of the horses, climbing on “lags,” propels
the saw, or the “separator.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At a “smithy” boat which had come
down the river, our arksmen had such a
horse-power made for them, and placed it
low in the keel, amidships. The two
paddle-wheels were attached to the topmost
axle of the “lags” wheel, up the incline of
which two horses walked abreast.</p>

<p class='c011'>A week or more was occupied in making
and adjusting the new gear, and there
were many doubts as to its success; but on
trial it was found that two horses were able
to propel this light keel-boat against the
river current at the rate of about four miles
an hour. It was necessary, however, to
have two spare horses. Four of their
horses were reserved for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>They still had the pet bear, which had
come to them so unexpectedly. Captain
Royce had supposed that they might fall in
with its former owners at New Orleans.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moses, who still laid claim to the animal,
had hopes of trading it for a rifle.
But Doctor Buchat had taken a fancy to
the bear, and named him “Napoleon,” and
Captain Royce wished to give him to the
genial Frenchman, who had repeatedly
helped them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moses demurred to this; and the doctor,
perceiving how matters stood with the
boy, offered him a pair of antique, silver-mounted
dueling pistols for his pet—not
a very suitable present for a boy, but the
only thing he could give.</p>

<p class='c011'>The pistols were long-barreled old flintlocks,
provided with “hair” triggers, and
Moses was much elated. After a discussion,
however, he reluctantly consented to
give Lewis one of them; and this burning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>question being at last settled, the two boys
set off to take Napoleon to Doctor Buchat’s
house, which was on Good-Children Street,
beyond the French market.</p>

<p class='c011'>They confined the bear’s mouth in a
strong muzzle and led him by his chain.
Wistar Royce went along with them to
lend a hand, in case of need, and to carry
in a bag two vertebræ of the mastodon,
which were overlooked in the hold of the
ark when the rest of the skeleton was hauled
to the doctor’s house.</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Royce had that day given each
arksman his share of the proceeds of the voyage;
and John Kenton, Clark MacAfee and
Merrick also went along with the boys, bent
on celebrating the occasion at the “Sure Enuf
Hotel,” kept by a tremendously stout pioneer
woman, known as “Old Ma’am Colby.”
This was a place of common resort for flatboatmen,
and was in a locality called “The
Swamp,” at the farther end of Girod Street.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>But the three boys went on with their
bear past the American quarter, and entered
the city proper by the Tchoupitoulas
gate.</p>

<p class='c011'>There chanced to be a festival in progress,
which, judging from the date, may
have been “King’s day,” a <i>fete</i> celebrated
by the negroes with songs and dances.</p>

<p class='c011'>A group of shouting youngsters set upon
the boys, pelting them with little bags containing
sugar and rice, also dust and snuff,
that caused boisterous sneezing. The revelers
began chanting an improvised song about
<i>les jeunes Kaintocks</i>. This may have been
good-natured chaff, but our young arksmen
did not like it; no more did Napoleon,
who was distressed by sneezing with a
muzzle on his nose.</p>

<p class='c011'>They got away from this first group of
roisterers, and hastened toward the doctor’s
house; but near the market they encountered
a greater and much more formidable crowd,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>in fantastic dress, wearing masks and bearing
grotesque effigies aloft on poles.</p>

<p class='c011'>To eyes unused to such parades, the
spectacle was a startling one. The maskers
wore all sorts of frightful head-gear—cocks’
heads, with huge red combs and bills a
foot long, lions’ heads and tigers’ heads,
bulls’ heads and dogs’ heads, Indians, crocodiles,
serpents with forked tongues; and
all were crowing, growling, bellowing,
barking, whooping and hissing, with an
added chorus from scores of horns and
conch-shells. The uproar, indeed, was
incredible. In this fantastic mob our young
friends found themselves suddenly engulfed,
and became objects of most undesirable
attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Mira a los Kaintock malos!</i>” (Look at
these Yankee rascals!) cried a tipsy Spanish
sailor, and immediately an eddy of maskers
circled round them, bawling forth a song
then much in vogue:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>“<i>’Mericain coquin,</i></div>

      <div class='line'><i>Chez Miche d’Aquin!</i>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>which, freely translated, signifies that the
“Americans” are rogues who dress in
homespun, steal bread from the bake-shop,
and are all jail-birds! This was not complimentary—if
the boys had understood it.</p>
<p class='c011'>They cared less for abusive songs, however,
than for the horns that blared in their
faces, and two “Indians” who danced about
them, brandishing tomahawks. When
Lewis and Moses caught sight of these
pseudo-savages they made ready for trouble.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
The boys had never seen
anything like this before—such
horrible heads and
faces—or heard such a
din. The tightly-muzzled
“Napoleon” rose
on his haunches, rolling
his eyes wildly round.
Accustomed to play with
the arksmen, he was not much afraid of
anybody; but now he attempted to bolt.
The boys held him with difficulty.</p>

<p class='c011'>They still thought that it was probably
“fun.” But when those two “redskins”
rushed toward them with tomahawks they
were alarmed, the whoops were so ugly,
the hatchets looked so wicked! Out came
Moses’ old dueling pistol, which—like a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>boy—he had taken with him under his
deerskin smock.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lewis’ hands were so wound in the
bear’s chain that he could not draw his; but
Wistar, with his heavy bag of mammoth
back-bones, gave one “Indian” a “smash”
over the head that felled him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fortunately for Moses, trouble with the
hair-trigger resulted in his discharging the
pistol harmlessly into the ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the fracas now began in earnest,
and it might have ended badly for our
young <i>Kaintocks</i> had not a loud laugh been
heard and a high-pitched but powerful
voice bawled in a queer mixture of Spanish
and French: “<i>Paz! Paz, mes enfants!
Paz, mes petits!</i>”—“Peace! Peace, my
children!”</p>

<p class='c011'>This timely outcry came from a veranda
close at hand, where a stout old priest
in a brown gown, and a tall, dark man,
wearing a military cloak, stood watching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>the revelers. Immediately the former came
through the throng, stretching out his arms,
pushing them all aside as if they were in
very truth his “children.” His big, kind
face shone in the torchlight like a benevolent
gargoyle, and his voice was as oil on angry
waves.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Paz! Paz!</i>” he murmured, soothingly,
in that odd jumble of French and
Andalusian. “<i>No sangre! Todos de bon
coeur!</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>With his hands he patted one after
another, even Napoleon, who snuffed him
thoughtfully through his muzzle.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond doubt this was kind old “<i>Pere
Antoine</i>,” who, for forty years, was so
amiable and ubiquitous a figure in the New
Orleans of those early days; “<i>Pere Antoine
cheri</i>,” whom, although he was a Spaniard
by birth, the Creoles loved to adoration; the
brown-gowned old Capuchin who married
all the young couples, white, black and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>yellow, and christened all their children as
fast as they came into the world; who
heard and sympathized with them in all
their troubles, griefs and sins.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was the unselfish, incorruptible
guardian and lover of the city’s poor, who
handled alms-money by the hundredweight,
but lived in a little hut in the suburbs and
slept on two bare boards; who used to have
a great brown leather bag at his girdle for
a purse, often so full by mid-week of voluntary
silver and gold that, big as he was,
he could hardly carry it, yet always quite
empty—such was his charity—by Sunday
evening; the “<i>cher</i> Daddy Antoine” of the
street gamins, who tagged after him for his
blessing and <i>lagniappe</i>—and never failed to
get both.</p>

<p class='c011'>The dark man in the military cloak,
who laughed so heartily at the warlike
attitude of the three youngsters in coonskin
caps, was Señor Casa Calvo, the Spanish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>commissioner, who continued to live in
New Orleans after the transfer of the territory
to the United States.</p>

<p class='c011'>Feeling sure, from his kindly face and
the respect accorded him by the revelers,
that they had made a friend worthy of confidence,
the boys spoke to the priest of
Doctor Buchat, and by signs gave him to
understand that they were taking the bear
to his house. Wistar also showed him the
two huge vertebræ.</p>

<p class='c011'>So greatly piqued was their curiosity,
that both the priest and Señor Calvo accompanied
the boys to Doctor Buchat’s house.
So much animated talk ensued over the
mammoth skeleton that it was not till late
in the evening that the good doctor found
quarters for Napoleon—so late, indeed, that
the old naturalist kept his youthful visitors
overnight and to breakfast on the following
morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the boys’ last trip to the city,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>for that day Captain Royce had completed
his preparations for the long voyage up the
river, not forgetting numerous presents for
the people at home. Wistar, Charlie Hoyt
and Lewis, who had saved their profits
from the venture, also bought similar gifts.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of Kenton, MacAfee and Corson less
kindly mention can be made. Like many
other arksmen of those times, they had
squandered much of their money at saloons
and gaming-places in “The Swamp”; and
becoming much dissatisfied, they determined
to quit their more prosperous comrades, and
go home on foot through the wilderness, by
the “Natchez trail.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Putting together what they had left
from their dissipations, they bought a horse
and set off, Corson first riding for two
hours, then hitching the horse beside the
path, and going on afoot. When Kenton
and MacAfee came up, MacAfee mounted
and rode for two hours, then left the horse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>hitched for Kenton, who was coming on
behind. By the time Kenton had ridden
two hours he usually overtook Corson, who
then took his second turn. This was termed
“whipsaw traveling”, and must have been
hard for the poor horse.</p>

<p class='c011'>They expected to reach home in thirty-eight
days, and long in advance of their
former comrades on the “horse-boat.”
Captain Royce sent a message home by
them, and also a letter to Milly Ayer.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had previously sent word home
by two Cincinnati boats; neither of which,
however, had been able to forward the
message. Nor did the word or letter sent
by Corson and his companions come to
hand, for the three arksmen never reached
the settlement on the Ohio; what became
of them is not known. Savages or outlaws
may have murdered them; or, owing to
dissatisfaction, they may have gone to
“East Florida” or the Carolinas to live.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>The <i>Milly Ayer</i>, as her youthful captain
had chivalrously christened their new keel-boat,
was not ready to leave New Orleans
for the homeward voyage until January
24th; and still another day was lost, waiting
for a passenger who had offered Captain
Royce a hundred and fifty dollars to
be taken to St. Louis.</p>

<p class='c011'>This passenger was none other than the
waggish Lieutenant Charles Grimsby, who
is supposed to have carried a despatch from
General Wilkinson to Captain Amos Stoddard,
the first American governor of St.
Louis. Captain Stoddard, however, did
not assume the duties of office until the
10th of March following.</p>

<p class='c011'>The French settlers of St. Louis, indeed,
were still in ignorance of the sale and transfer
of the Mississippi Valley to the United
States, and the horse-boat of our young
arksmen was destined to bring them the
first positive intelligence of this event. Like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>the Creoles at New Orleans, they were
awaiting the arrival of a French army to
take possession of the country in the mighty
name of Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the morning of the arksmen’s departure—January
25th—an old acquaintance
returned in great haste and jumped
aboard the boat, resolutely bent on rejoining
his former messmates. This was none
other than Napoleon, the pet black bear,
whom they had presented to Doctor
Buchat.</p>

<p class='c011'>When first seen by Lewis, the bear was
coming back at a clumsy gallop up the
levee, dragging his chain and pursued by a
hundred young darkies, who were hastening
his flight with stones and clods. Instinct,
or keen scent, had brought him to the
<i>Milly Ayer</i>. He leaped aboard, whimpering
from mingled fear and gladness at recognizing
his old friends of the ark.</p>

<p class='c011'>But they, truth to say, did not want him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>Word was at once sent to Doctor Buchat.
It then transpired that the worthy savant of
Good-Children Street was not desirous of
recovering him; in fact, the doctor begged
that Captain Royce would make some other
disposition of the animal. He had turned
cross in his new surroundings, and had
been near devouring one of the doctor’s
maid servants.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shadwell Lincoln suggested a rifle-ball
as offering an easy way out of the difficulty,
but Moses and Lewis would not hear of
this. They still retained an affection for
their former pet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally, since the bear was aboard and
objected strenuously to going ashore, Lieutenant
Grimsby proposed that he should
take him to St. Louis as a present to the
new governor; and with this destination in
view, Napoleon began his return voyage up
the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last the long voyage began. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>horses were fresh, the gear worked well,
and the little craft plowed her way gallantly
up the river, making fairly good time for
many days, with few accidents.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides Lieutenant Grimsby, and Napoleon,
twelve still remained from the crew
of seventeen, which gave four shifts of three
men each for duty—the lookout, the steersman,
and the driver for the two horses.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wary in all matters that touched the
safety of his boat, Captain Royce had protected
the horse-power on each side with
thick planks, that no Indian or outlaw bullet
might disable his team when at work. The
stalls aft, where the resting animals stood,
as also the cabin for the crew, were likewise
covered in.</p>

<p class='c011'>Twelve hours a day was the usual traveling
time. They then tied up to the bank
for the night, at some point chosen with
an eye for defense and shelter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Commanded with such sagacity and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>prudence, the <i>Milly Ayer</i> reached the confluence
of the Ohio with the Mississippi on
February 22nd, having lost but four days,
which had been spent in fishing and hunting
to replenish the food supply, and in foraging
for the horses.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here for once Marion Royce seems to
have departed from his usual rule of carefully
avoiding quarrels. He had never forgiven
the brutal assault upon Corson at
“Cairo.” Corson’s sightless eye had been
a constant reminder of the indignity.</p>

<p class='c011'>The evening they reached the confluence
of the rivers it was agreed to give Cairo a
surprise. We are at liberty to surmise, however,
that the waggish Lieutenant Grimsby
had something to do with this practical
joke. His record afterward would seem to
justify such a conjecture.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the small hours of the night,
after the thin mists began to rise from the
river and lowlands, the <i>Milly Ayer</i>, using its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>sweeps instead of the horse-power, approached
where the big “broadhorn”—which
still sheltered Cairo and its queer
population—lay moored to the muddy bank.
Charlie Hoyt then quietly boarded it from
the skiff.</p>

<p class='c011'>At that hour every one appeared to be
asleep. Stepping aboard cautiously, Hoyt
first secured his skiff, then made one end of
a hawser, which he had brought along, fast
to the foot of a stanchion. This done, he
crept along the shoreward rail, and with a
large, sharp knife, severed the two old
cables which held Cairo to the shore; then
decamped in the skiff as silently as he had
come, paying out the hawser.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was some three hundred feet in
length, and as soon as Hoyt got back to the
keel he and his friends made the other end fast
inboard, poled off from the bank, and then,
heading down-stream again, set the horses at
work with a free application of the whip.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>The Ohio was then rising, and the old
broadhorn was afloat at its moorings. Yielding
slowly to the pull from the horse-boat,
it floated out and away—as a coal barge is
towed by a tug.</p>

<p class='c011'>In great but silent glee, our boatmen
touched up their horses. They meant to
tow Cairo down into the Mississippi, then
cut adrift and let it go on a voyage of discovery.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before they had gone far, however,
somebody waked up. First there were
drowsy shouts astern, then louder ones and
more of them, and then indeed pandemonium
broke loose on the old craft.
Lights glimmered in the misty darkness
and candles were seen dodging to and fro.
And now, hearing the clatter of the horse-power
and the noise of the paddles from
the keel, the Cairoese began hailing vigorously,
to learn what was the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ho, the barge!” they cried. “You’ve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>run foul of us! You’ve carried us clean
away! Avast thar! Heave-to!”</p>

<p class='c011'>They thought that some river craft had
run into them, and did not for a considerable
time discover the hawser, but continued
shouting for help to get back to their
moorings.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nearly bursting with suppressed laughter,
our arksmen said nothing, but kept the
horses hard at work. And with the strong
current helping on, both craft were now
going down-stream at a great rate.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Cairoese presently discovered the
hawser, and divined the nature of the
prank that was being played on them.
Their hails for aid and information suddenly
changed to threats and execrations not to
be recorded here.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon, too, a rifle flashed and a bullet
sang past; then another, and loads of buckshot
began to whistle and to pepper the
keel. Our delighted arksmen were all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>lying low, however, and had the horses
well protected. They still held on, and
kept the old broadhorn hurrying down the
river at twelve-knot speed.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the denizens of Cairo were not to
be long trifled with. Many of them had
experience as rivermen, and some were
desperate characters. Instead of casting off
the hawser, or cutting loose, numbers of
them suddenly began hauling their end of
it inboard, and despite the draft on it, soon
shortened the distance between the two
craft, with the evident design of boarding
the horse-boat.</p>

<p class='c011'>But this was what Captain Royce and
Shadwell Lincoln had been looking for, and
before much progress had been made, the
former quietly cut adrift himself, and veering
off, let Cairo go on its involuntary
voyage down-stream.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rifles still continued to crack, and not
a few bullets came aboard the <i>Milly Ayer</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>Captain Royce got away from his queer
“tow” without much difficulty, however,
and when day dawned was ten miles on his
way up the Mississippi, bound for St. Louis.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is said that Cairo did not get back to
its former moorings for a week or more.
And for years afterward rivermen were
wont to relate the story of the joke which
“Mack” Royce played on the “town.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Milly Ayer</i> was five days going from
the confluence of the Ohio up to St. Louis.
But, at a little before noon on the 27th, it
arrived in sight of the pretty clearing on
the west bank of the Mississippi, where
stood the hundred and eighty houses of
squared logs which comprised the St. Louis
of 1803.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pierre Laclede, a French trader, cleared
a site and built the first houses here in 1764.
In 1803 the houses of the French traders
and principal citizens stood along Main
Street, each at the center of what is now a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>city block, surrounded by high palisades, or
stone walls, for defensive purposes. Fruit
and vegetable gardens were within these
enclosures. There were two small taverns,
a bakery, two smithies and two grist-mills.
Many of the people were traders, and kept
a stock of goods at their houses.</p>

<p class='c011'>The luxuries, and even the necessities,
of life were excessively dear; coffee was
two dollars a pound, and sugar equally
high-priced. A knowledge of this had led
Captain Royce to lay in a stock of these
staples, after consenting to take Lieutenant
Grimsby as a passenger. And, as the event
proved, he was able to clear a dollar a
pound on four quintals of each.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the outset, however, a mad prank on
the part of the lieutenant came near getting
them in trouble. Knowing that the French
at St. Louis cherished a vast admiration for
Napoleon Bonaparte, and were expecting
that he would shortly take possession of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>Mississippi Valley, Grimsby bethought himself—since
their pet bear was named
Napoleon—to have some sport from the
coincidence. He said nothing to Captain
Royce, but persuaded Lewis and Moses to
assist him, and told them what to shout as
they drew in to the landing-place.</p>

<p><span class='small'>“NAPOLEON IS HERE! VIVE NAPOLEON!”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In those days the arrival of a keel-boat
from New Orleans was an event. Not
more than ten came up in the course of a
season. As soon as the <i>Milly Ayer</i> was
sighted, nearly the whole population came
running to the river bank, and were both
astonished and immensely delighted to see
Moses and Lewis waving the tricolor from
the top of the deck-house and hear them
shouting:</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Vive Napoleon!</i>” “<i>Napoleon est ici!</i>”
(Napoleon is here!) “<i>Napoleon chez vous!</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was sufficiently bad French, but it
was understood. And the effect ashore was
tremendous!</p>

“Napoleon has come!
<i>Napoleon est ici! Vive
Napoleon!</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a time the simple
French habitants
were mute with astonishment.
Then an answering shout rose:
“<i>Vive Napoleon! Vive la France!</i>” It was
like putting a match to fireworks. An indescribable
excitement ensued. The settlers
crowded the river bank. Trappers fired their
guns in the air. And now from all the more
distant houses, from the fort and from the
watch-tower, many others—traders, soldiers,
and even the governor and his secretary—came
hastening to the landing-place.</p>

<p class='c011'>Within five minutes more than a thousand
people collected, all vastly astonished
and overjoyed at the strange tidings.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>A babel of eager questions now burst
forth. Was it true? Where was the
mighty Frenchman? And who was worthy
to entertain him? All looked to Governor
Delassus. With inward consternation the
good governor bethought himself as to his
somewhat scanty accommodations. In
short, the prank was even more successful
than the waggish Grimsby had anticipated.
Intent on securing the full dramatic effect
of his joke at the proper moment, the
frivolous lieutenant had kept the bear out
of sight, in the horse stalls, till the boat
drew in to the bank. Then hauling him
suddenly forth by his chain, he made him
rear on his haunches in plain sight of all
and shouted, “<i>Voila Napoleon!</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>Lewis and Moses, from the deck above,
also cried, “Here’s Napoleon!” and burst
into shouts of laughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>A jest of this kind was quite in keeping
with the rough humor of frontiersmen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>but with these French people it fell very
flat. They neither understood nor appreciated
it; they were simply bewildered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Un ours!</i>” (a bear!) they murmured,
with glances of displeasure and many shrugs
of disgust.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Un ours!</i>” What did it all mean, and
what in the world were these Americans
laughing at? Where was the joke? They
failed to see anything laughable. “<i>Un
ours!</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>No one laughed, and at last the lieutenant
tried to explain his joke. “<i>Son nom
est Napoleon!</i>” said he, pointing to the bear.
“That is his name! Napoleon! He has
come to see you!” and Grimsby burst out
in another laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dismal silence continued to prevail
ashore, except that several, still shrugging
with comical little grimaces, muttered that
<i>Monsieur, l’Americain</i>, appeared to be <i>un
farceur</i>—a joker!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>“Ah, well,” cried Grimsby, disgusted
in turn by their lack of humor, “you had
better take a good look at him! It is the
only Napoleon that you will ever see come
up the Mississippi! Your grand Napoleon
has sold you out to the United States.
Within ten days your new American governor
will be here!”</p>

<p class='c011'>At this juncture Capt. Meriwether
Lewis, who had recently come there, made
his way down to the bank, and hailing
Captain Royce, whom he had previously
met at Marietta, lent his aid to explain the
matter to the governor and others. Captain
Lewis was at this time completing his preparations
for the famous Lewis and Clark
expedition, which, under direction of President
Jefferson, set off from St. Louis on the
10th of May following.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lieutenant Grimsby had not seen the
last of his joke, however. On setting off
from the <i>Milly Ayer</i> the next morning, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>lead Napoleon to the governor’s house, at
the northeast corner of Main and Walnut
Streets, he was stoned by some young loafers;
and in his efforts to catch one of them
he lost hold of Napoleon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The bear, alarmed by the stones, galloped
up the street and turned in at the
open gate of one of the palisaded courtyards.</p>

<p class='c011'>Immediately a great outcry ensued inside.
Children and women screamed, and
presently a gun was fired. Napoleon was
creating a terrible commotion, and it was
uncertain what damage to life or property
he might be doing. But Grimsby, being
overmatched by his assailants, was unable to
go in pursuit of him. After a scuffle the
lieutenant ran back to the river bank and
called on Moses, Lewis and Wistar Royce
to return with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The four set off together at a run, and
on reaching the scene of the skirmish, found
that Grimsby’s assailants had beaten a retreat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>and a worse outcry than ever was
issuing from within the courtyard of the
house where the pet bear had taken refuge.
But now the cries were those of pigs instead
of human beings. The gate had swung to
and latched, and the palisades were too
high to scale.</p>

<p class='c011'>After some delay Grimsby and his
friends forced the gate,—for the case seemed
urgent,—and found an odd state of affairs
prevailing within. In one corner of the
yard was a sow with a large litter of young
pigs. To these Napoleon was paying
assiduous attentions. But for each one that
he seized he was forced to fight a pitched
battle with the sow, which, in defense of
her young, attacked him with great intrepidity,
squealing and clacking her jaws in a
most ferocious manner. With a stroke of
his paw the bear was able to prostrate the
sow, but immediately she was on her feet
again, quite as fierce as before.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>There was such an uproar that the
rescue party did not at first notice what had
become of the people of the house till they
heard them calling out from the roof.</p>

<p class='c011'>The man, a French trader, had a gun,
the flint-lock of which he was endeavoring
to put in order. He had fired once, but
had failed to do the bear much injury.
The trader’s wife, children and two or
three female servants were behind him on
the roof, and they all besought the arksmen
to drive out the bear and save their poor
pigs.</p>

<p class='c011'>Grimsby and Moses laid hold of the
chain and tried to pull Napoleon away, but
he had become excited in the affray with
the sow. He was bleeding from several
slight wounds; and, moreover, had had a
taste of young pork. He turned upon his
masters so savagely that they were obliged
to let him go, but they finally succeeded in
driving him out of the enclosure.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>Attracted by the clamor, a considerable
crowd had collected in the street outside
the gate, and when the bear rushed forth
another hubbub rose. Napoleon ran up
Market Street, however, which was then a
mere country lane, and escaped through the
broken gate of the stockade which enclosed
the hamlet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Outside the stockade there were clearings,
fifty or sixty acres in extent, where
the people raised wheat, corn and vegetables.
It was while cultivating these crops
a few years before that the settlers were
surprised by the savages from the British
post at Michilimackinac during the American
Revolution. Across this cleared tract
Napoleon was now escaping. On reaching
the gateway of the stockade, Lewis caught
sight of his shaggy black coat as he bounded
over the charred logs that still encumbered
the fields.</p>

<p class='c011'>They all gave chase after him, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>Grimsby was very desirous of presenting
him to Major Stoddard; but the bear ran
fast and reached the woods. For the time
being, at least, he appeared to have had
more than enough of civilization and its
dubious luxuries—including young pigs
with savage mothers. Lewis and Moses
called after him in most endearing accents,
but he still ran on. They could hear his
long chain jingle as it dragged over logs;
and now and then they sighted him, but
could not overtake him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thinking, however, that he would stop
after awhile, they followed on for several
miles, through what was then a virgin
forest of chestnut, walnut and sycamore.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last they crossed a creek and saw the
bear ascending a hill. Near the top of this
hill they came upon him, hung up hard
and fast by his chain, the ring in the end
of which had caught between two fallen
tree trunks. He was panting hard, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>appeared to have had all the exercise he
desired. He licked Moses’ hand when the
boy patted his head, and went back with
them in a very docile frame of mind to the
governor’s house.</p>

<p class='c011'>The arksmen were far too desirous of
reaching home to dally longer than was
necessary in St. Louis. Having landed
his passenger according to agreement, and
disposed of his venture in coffee and sugar,
Captain Royce lost no time in returning
down the river. He was not sorry to
part company with the waggish Grimsby,
whose propensity for practical joking rendered
companionship with him both embarrassing
and unsafe.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having now the river current in aid of
the paddle-gear, they reached the confluence
with the Ohio in a little more than two
days. After what had taken place there a
week or more before, they judged it prudent
to go past “Cairo” during the small hours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>of the night. Beyond doubt this was a
wise precaution. It was learned subsequently
that the population of the old
“broadhorn” was watching the river for
them. Practical jokes have an unpleasant
habit of coming home to roost.</p>

<p class='c011'>On March 19th they “cordelled” up
Letart’s “Falls,” the scene of their encounter
with the Shawnees, and a little before
sunset, three days later—just a year and
two days from the time when they had
started—the <i>Milly Ayer</i> rounded the bend
below Fish Creek, and came in sight of
home.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the familiar hillocks and clearings
came into view, Lewis, Moses and Wistar
waxed wild with excitement and delight.
They danced and whooped; Moses actually
stood on his head, and Marion Royce felt
his own heart beating hard and fast. But
he was pondering gravely on all that might
have happened during their long absence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>and on the evil tidings that he must bear to
the mother of Louis Gist and the wife of
John Cutler.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not one word from home had reached
them in all that time; but he supposed
that Corson and MacAfee had arrived long
ago, bearing his message that the horse-boat
was on her way.</p>

<p class='c011'>In point of fact, however, no news had
come to the home people since that black
day in early June, when Gist had found his
way back and reported the capture of the
ark by the Indians.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gist’s account had been doubted by
many, and for a long time those anxious
little homesteads had waited and hoped
that further tidings would come. But when
September and October passed and winter
drew on, even the most sanguine grew
hopeless; and how disconsolately the spring
opened! For, not only had these pioneer
families lost the fruits of two years’ hard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>labor, but also their most efficient young
men. There seemed nothing left them
with which to begin another year; not even
heart and courage to labor on.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the Royce and Hoyt families there
was mourning for both their sons; and at
the Ayer farmhouse grief more silent, perhaps,
but even more poignant, was felt.
Milly was among those who had hoped
bravely on till midwinter. She and Molly
Royce were the last to give up faith that
Marion, Lewis and Moses had somehow
escaped and would yet come back.</p>

<p class='c011'>But when March passed and no tidings
came, despair fell on them, too, and the
despair of such hopeful young hearts is sad
to witness. The little settlement was in
mourning none the less sincere that there
was no black crape or sable plume for outward
symbols of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet one emblem of their grief these
sad-faced women and girls were able to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>contrive. They wove and fashioned little
shoulder capes from homespun linen, and
dyed them black with an “ink” made by
boiling the twigs of the swamp-maple.
Nine of these little black capes were worn that
spring, and one of those pathetic little tokens
of pioneer sorrow is still in existence, the
property of a lineal descendant of Milly Ayer.</p>

<p class='c011'>That afternoon Milly and Molly chanced
to be coming from Mrs. Merrick’s cabin,
when, as they climbed the hillside, where a
vista of the Ohio opened to view, Molly
saw the “keel” rounding the bend.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s a boat coming, Milly,” she
said, soberly enough; but Milly, thinking
of one that would never return, had hardly
the heart to look.</p>

<p class='c011'>Boats on the river were always objects
of interest then, however, and Molly presently
turned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s a keel,” she said. “It must be a
horse-boat, too, it comes so fast.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>“A Pittsburgh keel, it is likely,” Milly
replied, apathetically; “or, maybe, Marietta.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps it is from New Orleans,” said
Molly. “Oh, I wish we could hail them
and ask if they had ever heard anything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They had no real intention of doing so
bold a thing, yet for some moments they
stood watching the approaching craft,
which, to avoid the more rapid current, had
been keeping well over to the Virginia
shore.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s going to cross!” Molly exclaimed,
at last. “It’s heading this way! What a
noise the paddles make!”—for the wind
was southerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sturdily the little keel stemmed the
river current, making for the creek mouth.</p>

<img src='images/i359.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='small'>“THEY ARE GOING TO CALL AT OUR LANDING!”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“O Milly, I do believe they are going
to call at our landing!” the younger girl
now exclaimed in excitement. “Yes, they
are coming right into our creek! Hear the
horses’ feet clatter!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>“Perhaps they want to buy something—eggs,
or milk, or potatoes,” said Milly.
“We have a few eggs. We will go out on
the bluff above the landing, and answer if
they hail.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a little belt of hickory and
oak to pass through, and by the time the
two girls had come out on the bluff the
keel of our returning arksmen had entered
the mouth of the creek, but was passing
behind the thick, tall fringe of sycamores
that bordered the stream.</p>

<p class='c011'>A moment later it emerged into the
cleared space about the jetty, and there
stood Moses on top of the cabin roof. He
had discovered them upon the bluff, and was
swinging his cap, shouting:</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s Milly! There’s Molly!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thereupon Marion and Wistar, who
were forward with pike-poles, to fend off, and
Lewis, who was at the sweep aft, all looked up
the bank and joined in Moses’ joyous shouts.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>So sudden was the transition from sorrow
to joy, it is not strange that instead of
rushing down to the landing, the two girls,
after a feeble effort to answer, sat down,
quite overcome, and burst into tears. When
Captain Royce and the others jumped ashore
and ran up to where they were, Milly and
Molly were found smiling, indeed, but with
such wet cheeks that, noting the little black
capes, Marion cried, “O Milly, who is
dead?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And it is said that Milly’s faint little
reply was, “Nobody, Marion—except—except—you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>We may be sure that these brave youths
were not long convincing the girls that they
were still very much alive; and, not only
Milly and Molly, but all the rest of the little
community. For just then Mrs. Ayer, who
had seen the keel heading in, came hastening
to the landing. The Hoyt boys’ father
also made his appearance, and immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>the glorious news was shouted from house
to house.</p>

<p class='c011'>The last to hear of the safe return of the
arksmen was Uncle Amasa. He had broken
in the long months of grieving for the disappearance
of Jimmy, whom he believed
dead, and he came in slowly, with as much
heaviness in his heart as he had of sympathy
for those whom he was coming to congratulate.
But when he neared the group about
the landing he saw a figure that made his
heart quicken. Jimmy saw him at the
same moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—I’ve seen pa,” Jimmy said in strange,
inconsequent sort of haste. “He sent his
love to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Uncle Amasa laid trembling hands
on him, and wordlessly drew him close.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy looked about at the familiar
place, scarred with the fire where the shed
had stood. “The man that set it is killed,”
he said. “He did it to spite you, grandfather,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>for an old, old grudge. He broached
the barrels and then when he couldn’t
drink any more he set fire to the shed and
rode away, and I found him.” He looked
back at the old man.—“Governor Claiborne
of Mississippi sent his regards to you.
He says we’re cousins. He was right at the
head of everything. You would have liked
that. I tell you, if you’d been at New
Orleans, you’d have been proud of the
family.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Marion came up and shook Uncle
Amasa’s hand. “You would have been
proud right along,” he said, eagerly. “It
was Jimmy that pulled us through.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Amasa chuckled and patted Jimmy’s
shoulder. “I kinder thought it would
do Jimmy right much good to go out into
the world,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Master Hempstead now came up and
shook Jimmy’s hand. “When we last met
did not Sir Balin smite Sir Lanceor until the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>blood flowed over his hawberk? Zounds,
son, I am glad that you’ve found that somebody
else was the incendiary.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I owe you an apology, sir,” said Jimmy
with great respect. “I was too hasty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s a grand thing to be hasty,” murmured
Uncle Amasa, rubbing the bald side
of his head where the Indians had scalped
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess the governor thought so when
Jimmy saved him from the assassin’s bullet,”
laughed Marion. “It seems to be all a
question of being hasty in the right place.
Don’t you think so, Jimmy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess that’s it,” said Jimmy, happily.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then began such a jubilee as this small
settlement had never known before. “Brush
College” had another holiday, and Master
Hempstead became vastly exhilarated—wholly
from joy, let us hope. No one, it is
said, slept at all that night,—unless a few
infants,—and dawn surprised the entire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>population at the capacious Royce cabin,
still listening to the story of that memorable
voyage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Otherwise, too, the arksmen had great
news to tell. New Orleans was no longer
a Spanish possession, but an American city,
where Western keels, arks and barges could
go without let or hindrance; and the Mississippi
was a free river from St. Louis to
the Gulf.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was then—along toward morning—that
Master Hempstead waxed wondrously
eloquent, and made a great speech, still remembered,
in which, with prophetic vision,
he predicted and portrayed the future glories
of the middle West.</p>

<p class='c011'>So much remains to relate that I bring
the narrative to a close most reluctantly.
The annals of the Royce and Ayer families
have it that Milly and Marion made the
most remarkable wedding tour of those
times, journeying even to Philadelphia and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>to the new capital city of Washington,
where they attended one of President Jefferson’s
very democratic receptions. But those
things belong to the annals of other years.
Our task was but to tell the story of the
Ark of 1803.</p>
